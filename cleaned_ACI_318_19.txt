This Code was developed by an ANSI-approved consensus process and addresses structural systems, members, and connections, including cast-in-place, precast, shotcrete, plain, nonprestressed, prestressed, and composite construction. Among the subjects covered are: design and construction for strength, serviceability, and durability; load combinations, load factors, and strength reduction factors; struc- WXUDO DQDO\VLV PHWKRGV GHÀHFWLRQ OLPLWV PHFKDQLFDO DQG DGKHVLYH DQFKRULQJ WR FRQFUHWH GHYHORSPHQW DQG VSOLFLQJ RI UHLQ- IRUFHPHQW FRQVWUXFWLRQ GRFXPHQW LQIRUPDWLRQ ¿HOG LQVSHFWLRQ DQG WHVWLQJ DQG PHWKRGV WR HYDOXDWH WKH VWUHQJWK RI H[LVWLQJ structures. The Code was substantially reorganized and reformatted in 2014, and this Code continues and expands that same organi- zational philosophy. The principal objectives of the reorganization were to present all design and detailing requirements for structural systems or for individual members in chapters devoted to those individual subjects, and to arrange the chapters in a manner that generally follows the process and chronology of design and construction. Information and procedures that are common to the design of multiple members are located in utility chapters.

The Code is written in a format that allows such reference without change to its language. Therefore, background details or suggestions for carrying out the requirements or intent of the Code provisions cannot be included within the Code itself. The Commentary is provided for this purpose. Some considerations of the committee in developing the Code are discussed in the Commentary, with emphasis given to the explanation of new or revised provisions. Much of the research data referenced in preparing the Code is cited for the user desiring to study individual questions in greater detail. Other documents that provide suggestions for carrying out the require- ments of the Code are also cited. Technical changes from ACI 318-14 to ACI 318-19 are outlined in the August 2019 issue of Concrete International and are marked in the text of this Code with change bars in the margins.

These are two separate but coordi- nated documents, with Code text placed in the left column and the corresponding Commentary text aligned in the right column. Commentary section numbers are preceded by an “R” to further distinguish them from Code section numbers. The two documents are bound together solely for the user’s convenience. Each document carries a separate enforceable and distinct copyright. As the name implies, “Building Code Requirements for Structural Concrete” is meant to be used as part of a legally DGRSWHG EXLOGLQJ FRGH DQG DV VXFK PXVW GL൵HU LQ IRUP DQG VXEVWDQFH IURP GRFXPHQWV WKDW SURYLGH GHWDLOHG VSHFL¿FD- tions, recommended practice, complete design procedures, or design aids. The Code is intended to cover all buildings of the usual types, both large and small. Requirements more stringent than the Code provisions may be desirable for unusual construction. The Code and Commentary cannot replace sound engineering knowledge, experience, and judgment. A building code states only the minimum requirements necessary to provide for public health and safety. The Code is based on this principle. For any structure, the owner or the licensed design professional may require the quality of materials and construction to be higher than the minimum requirements necessary to protect the public as stated in the Code. However, lower standards are not permitted. The Code has no legal status unless it is adopted by the government bodies having the police power to regulate building design and construction. Where the Code has not been adopted, it may serve as a reference to good practice even though it has no legal status. The Code and Commentary are not intended for use in settling disputes between the owner, engineer, archi- tect, contractor, or their agents, subcontractors, material suppliers, or testing agencies. Therefore, the Code cannot GH¿QH WKH FRQWUDFW UHVSRQVLELOLW\ RI HDFK RI WKH SDUWLHV LQ usual construction. General references requiring compliance ZLWK WKH &RGH LQ WKH SURMHFW VSHFL¿FDWLRQV VKRXOG EH DYRLGHG because the contractor is rarely in a position to accept responsibility for design details or construction require- ments that depend on a detailed knowledge of the design. Design-build construction contractors, however, typically combine the design and construction responsibility. Gener- ally, the contract documents should contain all of the neces- sary requirements to ensure compliance with the Code.

The Commentary discusses some of the considerations of Committee 318 in developing the provisions contained in the Code.

The Commentary is not intended to provide a complete historical background concerning the development of the Code, nor is it intended to provide a detailed résumé of the studies and research data reviewed by the committee in formulating the provisions of the Code. However, references to some of the research data are provided for those who wish to study the background material in depth. The Commentary directs attention to other documents that provide suggestions for carrying out the requirements and intent of the Code. However, those documents and the Commentary are not a part of the Code. The Commentary is intended for the use of individuals ZKR DUH FRPSHWHQW WR HYDOXDWH WKH VLJQL¿FDQFH DQG OLPL- tations of its content and recommendations, and who will accept responsibility for the application of the information it contains. ACI disclaims any and all responsibility for the stated principles. The Institute shall not be liable for any loss or damage arising therefrom. Reference to the Commen- tary shall not be made in construction documents. If items found in the Commentary are desired by the licensed design professional to be a part of the contract documents, they shall be restated in mandatory language for incorporation by the licensed design professional.

R1.4.6 ACI 332 addresses only the design and construc- tion of cast-in-place footings, foundation walls supported on continuous footings, and slabs-on-ground for limited resi- dential construction applications. The 2015 IBC requires design and construction of residen- tial post-tensioned slabs on expansive soils to be in accor- dance with PTI DC10.5-12, which provides requirements for slab-on-ground foundations, including soil investigation, design, and analysis. Guidance for the design and construc- tion of post-tensioned slabs-on-ground that are not on expan- sive soils can be found in ACI 360R. Refer to R1.4.8. R1.4.7 The design and installation of concrete piles fully embedded in the ground is regulated by the general building code. The 2019 edition of the Code contains some provisions that previously were only available in the general building code. In addition to the provisions in this Code, recommen- dations for concrete piles are given in ACI 543R, recom- mendations for drilled piers are given in ACI 336.3R, and recommendations for precast prestressed concrete piles are given in “Recommended Practice for Design, Manufacture, and Installation of Prestressed Concrete Piling” (PCI 1993).

Joints and connections are locations common to intersecting members or are items used to connect one member to another, but the distinction between members, joints, and connections can depend on how the structure is idealized. Throughout this chapter, the term “members” often refers to “structural members, joints, and connections.” Although the Code is written considering that a structural system comprises these members, many alternative arrange- ments are possible because not all structural member types are used in all building structural systems. The selection types RI WKH PHPEHUV WR XVH LQ D VSHFL¿F SURMHFW DQG WKH UROH RU roles these member types play is made by the licensed design professional complying with requirements of the Code. R4.4.2 In the chapter for each type of structural member, requirements follow the same general sequence and scope, including general requirements, design limits, required strength, design strength, reinforcement limits, reinforce- ment detailing, and other requirements unique to the type of member. R4.4.3 Some materials, structural members, or systems that may not be recognized in the prescriptive provisions of the Code may still be acceptable if they meet the intent of the Code. Section 1.10.1 outlines the procedures for obtaining approval of alternative materials and systems. R4.4.4 The design should be based on members and connections that provide design strengths not less than the strengths required to transfer the loads along the load path.

R4.4.6 6HLVPLF IRUFH UHVLVWLQJ V\VWHP R4.4.6.1 Design requirements in the Code are based on the seismic design category to which the structure is assigned.

Finite element analysis was introduced in the 2014 Code to explicitly recognize a widely used analysis method. R6.2.4.1 Code editions from 1971 to 2014 contained provisions for use of the direct design method and the equiv- alent frame method. These methods are well-established and are covered in available texts. These provisions for gravity load analysis of two-way slabs have been removed from the Code because they are considered to be only two of several analysis methods currently used for the design of two-way slabs. The direct design method and the equivalent frame method of the 2014 Code, however, may still be used for the analysis of two-way slabs for gravity loads.

The usual result is a reduction in the values of maximum negative moments in the support regions and an increase in the values of positive moments between supports from those calculated by elastic analysis. However, because negative moments are typically determined for one loading arrangement and positive moments for another (6.4.3 provides an exception for certain loading conditions), economies in reinforcement can sometimes be realized by reducing maximum elastic positive moments and increasing negative moments, thus narrowing the envelope of maximum negative and positive moments at any section in the span (Bondy 2003).

Also, these studies indicate that adequate rotational capacity for the redistribution of moments allowed by the Code is available if the members satisfy 6.6.5.1. The provisions for redistribution of moments apply equally to prestressed members (Mast 1992). The elastic deformations caused by a nonconcordant tendon change the amount of inelastic rotation required to obtain a given amount of redistribution of moments. Conversely, for a beam with a given inelastic rotational capacity, the amount by which the moment at the support may be varied is changed by an amount equal to the secondary moment at the support due to prestressing. Thus, the Code requires that secondary moments caused by reactions generated by prestressing forces be included in determining design moments.

For example, this beam might be used to support a wall or concentrated load that the slab alone cannot support. In that case, the primary slab reinforcement is parallel to the beam and the perpen- dicular reinforcement is usually sized for temperature and shrinkage. The reinforcement required by this provision is intended to consider “unintended” negative moments that may develop over the beam that exceed the requirements for temperature and shrinkage reinforcement alone.

Refer to R9.6.3 for addi- tional information. R7.6.3.1 Solid slabs and footings have less stringent minimum shear reinforcement requirements than beams because there is a possibility of load sharing between weak and strong areas. However, research (Angelakos et al. 2001; Lubell et al. 2004; Brown et al. 2006) has shown that deep, lightly reinforced one-way slabs, particularly if constructed with high-strength concrete or concrete having a small coarse aggregate size, may fail at shears less than Vc calculated from Eq. (22.5.5.1). One-way slabs subjected to concen- trated loads are more likely to exhibit this vulnerability. Results of tests on precast, prestressed hollow-core units (Becker and Buettner 1985; Anderson 1978) with h 12.5 in. have shown shear strengths greater than those calcu- lated by Eq. (22.5.6.3.1a) and Eq. (22.5.6.3.2).

The longitudinal reinforcement required for torsion is added at each section to the longitudinal reinforcement required for bending moment that acts concurrently with the torsion. The longitudinal reinforcement is then chosen for this sum, but should not be less than the amount required for the maximum bending moment at that section if this exceeds the moment acting concurrently with the torsion. If the maximum bending moment occurs at one section, such as midspan, while the maximum torsional moment occurs at another, such as the face of the support, the total longitudinal reinforce- ment required may be less than that obtained by adding the PD[LPXP ÀH[XUDO UHLQIRUFHPHQW SOXV WKH PD[LPXP WRUVLRQDO reinforcement. In such a case, the required longitudinal rein- forcement is evaluated at several locations. R9.5.4.4 Torsion causes an axial tensile force in the longi- tudinal reinforcement balanced by the force in the diagonal concrete compression struts. In a nonprestressed beam, the tensile force must be resisted by longitudinal reinforcement having an axial tensile strength of AƐfy. This reinforcement LV LQ DGGLWLRQ WR WKH UHTXLUHG ÀH[XUDO UHLQIRUFHPHQW DQG LV distributed uniformly inside and around the perimeter of the closed transverse reinforcement so that the resultant of AƐfy acts along the axis of the member. In a prestressed beam, the same approach (providing additional reinforcing bars with strength AƐfy) may be followed, or overstrength of the prestressed reinforcement can be used to resist some of the axial force AƐfy. The stress in the prestressed reinforcement at nominal strength will be between fse and fps. A portion of the AƐfy force can be resisted by a force of Aps ̈fpt in the prestressed reinforce- ment. The stress required to resist the bending moment can be calculated as Mu/(ࢥ0.9dpAps).

In such cases, the deviations in the tendons tend to straighten out when the tendons are stressed. This process may impose large tensile stresses in webs, and severe cracking may develop if no web reinforcement is provided. Unintended curvature of the tendons, and the resulting tensile stresses in webs, may be minimized by securely tying tendons to stirrups that are rigidly held in place by other elements of the reinforcement cage. The recommended maximum spacing of stirrups used for this purpose is the smaller of 1.5h or 4 ft. If applicable, the shear reinforcement provisions of 9.6.3 and 9.7.6.2.2 will require closer stirrup spacings. For repeated loading of beams, the possibility of inclined diagonal tension cracks forming at stresses appreciably smaller than under static loading should be taken into account in design.

Therefore, expressions (a) and (c) in Table 9.6.3.4 provide for a gradual increase in the minimum area of transverse reinforcement with increasing concrete strength. Expressions (b) and (d) in Table 9.6.3.4 provide for a minimum area of transverse reinforcement independent of concrete strength and govern for concrete strengths less than 4400 psi.

If a stirrup group has more than two legs, only the legs adjacent to the sides of the beam are considered, as discussed in R9.5.4.3. Tests (Roller and Russell 1990) of high-strength rein- forced concrete beams have indicated the need to increase the minimum area of shear reinforcement to prevent shear failures when inclined cracking occurs. Although there are a limited number of tests of high-strength concrete beams in torsion, the equation for the minimum area of transverse closed stirrups has been made consistent with calculations required for minimum shear reinforcement. R9.6.4.3 Under combined torsion and shear, the torsional cracking moment decreases with applied shear, which leads to a reduction in torsional reinforcement required to prevent brittle failure immediately after cracking. When subjected to pure torsion, reinforced concrete beam specimens with less than 1 percent torsional reinforcement by volume have IDLOHG DW ¿UVW WRUVLRQDO FUDFNLQJ MacGregor and Ghoneim 1995).

It is the intent of this section of the Code to improve the redundancy and ductility in structures so that in the event of damage to a major supporting element or an abnormal loading event, the resulting damage may be localized and the structure will have a higher probability of maintaining overall stability. With damage to a support, top reinforcement that is FRQWLQXRXV RYHU WKH VXSSRUW EXW QRW FRQ¿QHG E\ VWLUUXSV will tend to tear out of the concrete and will not provide the catenary action required to bridge the damaged support. By making a portion of the bottom reinforcement continuous, catenary action can be provided. If the depth of a continuous beam changes at a support, the bottom reinforcement in the deeper member should be terminated into the support with a standard hook or headed bar and the bottom reinforcement in the shallower member should be extended into and fully developed in the deeper member. R9.7.7.1 Requiring continuous top and bottom reinforce- ment in perimeter or spandrel beams provides a continuous tie around the structure. It is not the intent to require a tension tie of continuous reinforcement of constant size around the entire perimeter of a structure, but rather to require that one- KDOI RI WKH WRS ÀH[XUDO UHLQIRUFHPHQW UHTXLUHG WR H[WHQG SDVW WKH SRLQW RI LQÀHFWLRQ E\ EH IXUWKHU H[WHQGHG DQG spliced at or near midspan as required by 9.7.7.5.

For a deep beam supporting gravity loads, this provision applies if the loads are applied on the top of the beam and the beam is supported on its bottom face. If the loads are applied through the sides or bottom of such a member, the strut-and-tie method, as GH¿QHG LQ Chapter 23 should be used to design reinforce- ment to internally transfer the loads to the top of the beam and distribute them to adjacent supports.

(b) Positive moment tension reinforcement shall be continuous or spliced with that of the adjacent spans. R9.9.4.4 In deep beams, the stress in the longitudinal rein- forcement is more uniform along the length than that of a beam or region that is not deep. High reinforcement stresses normally limited to the center region of a typical beam can extend to the supports in deep beams. Thus, the ends of longitudinal reinforcement may require positive anchorage in the form of standard hooks, bar heads, or other mechan- ical anchorage at supports. R9.9.4.5 The use of the strut-and-tie method for the design of deep beams illustrates that tensile forces in the bottom tie reinforcement need to be anchored at the face of the support. From this consideration, tie reinforcement should be contin- uous or developed at the face of the support (Rogowsky and MacGregor 1986).

Diaphragms also tie the building elements together into a complete three-dimensional system and provide lateral support to those elements by connecting them to the lateral-force-resisting system. Typically, diaphragms DOVR VHUYH DV ÀRRU DQG URRI VODEV RU DV SDUNLQJ VWUXFWXUH ramps and, therefore, support gravity loads. A diaphragm may include chords and collectors. When subjected to lateral loads, such as the in-plane iner- tial loads acting on the roof diaphragm of Fig. R12.1.1, a diaphragm acts essentially as a beam spanning horizon- tally between vertical elements of the lateral-force-resisting system. The diaphragm thus develops in-plane bending moments, shears, and possibly other actions. Where vertical elements of the lateral-force-resisting system do not extend along the full depth of the diaphragm, collectors may be required to collect the diaphragm shear and transfer it to the vertical elements. The term “distributor” is sometimes used to describe a collector that transfers force from a vertical element of the lateral-force-resisting system into the diaphragm.

(c) Connection forces—Wind pressure acting on exposed building surfaces generates out-of-plane forces on those surfaces.

R12.5.3.6 This Code does not contain provisions for untopped diaphragms in buildings assigned to Seismic Design Categories D, E, and F. Diaphragm shear in untopped diaphragms can be resisted by using shear-friction reinforce- ment in grouted joints (FEMA P751).

F t nec U WR esp sp ACI Collection Licensed to: Shannon Banchero R13.2.6.1 Permissible soil pressures or permissible deep foundation strengths are determined by principles of soil mechanics and in accordance with the general building code. The size of the base area of a footing on soil or the number and arrangement of deep foundation members are established by using allowable geotechnical strength and service-level load combinations or by using nominal geotechnical strength with resistance factor and factored load combinations. Only the calculated end moments at the base of a column or pedestal require transfer to the footing. The minimum moment requirement for slenderness considerations given in 6.6.4.5 need not be considered for transfer of forces and moments to footings. R13.2.6.3 To design a footing or pile cap for strength, the induced reactions due to factored loads applied to the foundation should be determined. For a single concentri- cally-loaded spread footing, the soil pressure due to factored loading is calculated as the factored load divided by the base area of the footing. For the case of footings or mats with eccentric loading, applied factored loads may be used to deter- mine soil pressures. For pile caps or mats supported by deep foundations, applied factored loads may be used to deter- mine member reactions. However, the resulting pressures or reactions may be incompatible with the geotechnical design resulting in unacceptable subgrade reactions or instability (Rogowsky and Wight 2010). In such cases, the design should be adjusted in coordination with the geotechnical engineer. Only the calculated end moments at the base of a column or pedestal require transfer to the footing. The minimum moment requirements for slenderness considerations given in 6.6.4.5 need not be considered for transfer of forces and moments to footings.

Shear failure in plain concrete will be a diagonal tension failure, occurring when the principal tensile stress near the centroidal axis becomes equal to the tensile strength of the concrete. Because the major portion of the principal tensile stress results from shear, the Code safe- guards against tension failure by limiting the permissible shear at the centroidal axis as calculated from the equation for a section of homogeneous material: v = VQ Ib where v and V are the shear stress and shear force, respec- tively, at the section considered; Q is the statical moment of the area above or below the centroid of the gross section calculated about the centroidal axis; I is the moment of inertia of the gross section; and b is the section width where shear stress is being calculated.

The overall integrity of a structure can be substantially enhanced by minor changes in the amount, location, and detailing of member reinforcement and in the detailing of connection hardware. The integrity ties should constitute a complete load path, and load transfers along that load path should be as direct as possible. Eccentricity of the load path, especially within any connection, should be minimized. R16.2.4.2 The connection between the diaphragm and the member laterally supported by the diaphragm may be direct or indirect. For example, a column may be connected directly to the diaphragm, or it may be connected to a span- drel beam, which is connected to the diaphragm. R16.2.4.3 Base connections and connections at hori- zontal joints in precast columns and wall panels, including structural walls, are designed to transfer all design forces and moments. The minimum integrity tie requirements of this provision are not additive to these design require- ments. Common practice is to place the wall integrity ties symmetrically about the vertical centerline of the wall panel and within the outer quarters of the panel width, wherever possible. 16.2.3 Design strength 16.2.3.1 For each applicable load combination, design strengths of precast member connections shall satisfy ࢥSn U (16.2.3.1) ࢥ shall be determined in accordance with 21.2. 16.2.3.3 At the contact surface between supported and supporting members, or between a supported or supporting member and an intermediate bearing element, nominal bearing strength for concrete surfaces, Bn, shall be calculated in accordance with 22.8.

This is because the hori- zontal component of the inclined concrete compression strut is transferred to the primary tension reinforcement at the location of the vertical load.

Other standards may require more stringent safety levels during temporary handling. The format for this chapter was revised in 2019 to be more consistent with the other chapters of this Code. R17.1.2 Typical cast-in headed studs and headed bolts with head geometries consistent with ASME B1.1, B18.2.1, and B18.2.6 have been tested and proven to behave predict- ably; therefore, calculated pullout strengths are acceptable. Post-installed expansion, screw, and undercut anchors do not have predictable pullout strengths, and therefore quali- ¿FDWLRQ WHVWV WR HVWDEOLVK WKH SXOORXW VWUHQJWKV DFFRUGLQJ WR ACI 355.2 are required. For post-installed expansion, screw, and undercut anchors to be used in conjunction with the requirements of this chapter, the results of the ACI 355.2 tests have to indicate that pullout failures exhibit acceptable load-displacement characteristics or that pullout failures are precluded by another failure mode. For adhesive anchors, the characteristic bond stress and suitability for structural applications are established by testing in accordance with ACI 355.4. Adhesive anchors are particularly sensitive to a number of factors including instal- lation direction and load type. If adhesive anchors are used to resist sustained tension, the provisions include testing requirements for horizontal or upwardly inclined installa- WLRQV LQ GHVLJQ UHTXLUHPHQWV LQ FHUWL¿FDWLRQ requirements in 26.7, and inspection requirements in 26.13. $GKHVLYH DQFKRUV TXDOL¿HG LQ DFFRUGDQFH ZLWK $&, are tested in concrete with compressive strengths within two ranges: 2500 to 4000 psi and 6500 to 8500 psi. Bond strength is, in general, not highly sensitive to concrete compressive strength. R17.1.3 ACI 355.2 prohibits reuse of post-installed mechanical anchors. R17.1.4 The exclusion of load applications producing high-cycle fatigue or extremely short duration impact (such as blast or shock wave) from the scope of this chapter is not meant to exclude earthquake loads. Section 17.10 presents additional requirements for design when earthquake loads are included.

R17.1.6 Concrete breakout strength in tension and shear should be considered for reinforcing bars in a group used as anchorage. Concrete breakout behavior can occur even if reinforcement is fully developed in accordance with Chapter 25. Breakout behavior of straight reinforcement as a group is analogous to tension and shear breakout behavior of adhesive anchors whereby hef is taken as equal to or less than the embedded bar length. Similarly, breakout behavior of hooked and headed reinforcement groups is similar to tension and shear breakout behavior of headed anchors. Consideration should be given to extending bars beyond the development length. As an alternative to explicit determination of the concrete breakout strength of a group, anchor reinforcement provided in accordance with 17.5.2.1 may be used, or the reinforce- ment should be extended. R17.2—General R17.2.1 If the strength of an anchor group is governed by concrete breakout, the behavior is brittle, and there is limited redistribution of forces between the highly stressed and less stressed anchors. In this case, the theory of elasticity is required to be used, assuming the attachment that distrib- XWHV ORDGV WR WKH DQFKRUV LV VX൶FLHQWO\ VWL൵ 7KH IRUFHV LQ WKH anchors are considered to be proportional to the external load and its distance from the neutral axis of the anchor group.

In this case, an analysis based on the theory of elas- ticity will be conservative. Cook and Klingner (1992a,b) and Lotze et al. (2001) discuss nonlinear analysis, using theory of plasticity, for the determination of the strengths of ductile anchor groups. R17.2.2 The design performance of adhesive anchors cannot be ensured by establishing a minimum concrete compressive strength at the time of installation in early-age concrete. Therefore, a concrete age of at least 21 days at the time of adhesive anchor installation was adopted.

R17.3—Design limits R17.3.1 A limited number of tests of cast-in and post- installed anchors in high-strength concrete (Primavera et al. 1997) indicate that the design procedures contained in this chapter become unconservative with increasing concrete strength, particularly for cast-in anchors in concrete with compressive strengths in the range of 11,000 to 12,000 psi. Until further tests are available, an upper limit on fcƍ of 10,000 psi has been imposed for the design of cast-in anchors. This limitation is consistent with those for shear strength, torsion strength, and reinforcement development length in this Code (22.5.3.1, 22.6.3.1, 22.7.2.1, 25.4.1.4).

In the 2002 through 2008 editions of the Code, there were limitations on the diameter and embedment of anchors to calculate the concrete breakout strength. These limitations were necessitated by the lack of test results on anchors with diameters larger than 2 in. and embedment lengths longer than 24 in. In 2011, limitations on anchor diameter and embedment length were revised to limit the diameter to 4 in. based on the results of tension and shear tests on large-diameter anchors with deep embed- ments (Lee et al. 2007, 2010). These tests included 4.25 in. diameter anchors, embedded 45 in., tested in tension and 3 in. diameter anchors tested in shear.

The various types of steel and concrete failure modes for anchors are shown in Fig. R17.5.1.2(a) and R17.5.1.2(b). Comprehensive discus- sions of anchor failure modes are included in CEB (1997), Fuchs et al. (1995), Eligehausen and Balogh (1995), and Cook et al. (1998). Tension failure modes related to concrete include concrete breakout failure (applicable to all anchor types), pullout failure (applicable to cast-in anchors, post- installed expansion, screw, and undercut anchors), side- face blowout failure (applicable to headed anchors), and bond failure (applicable to adhesive anchors). Shear failure modes related to concrete include concrete breakout failure and concrete pryout (applicable to all anchor types). These failure modes are described in the deemed-to-comply provi- sions of 17.6.2, 17.6.3, 17.6.4, 17.6.5, 17.7.2, and 17.7.3. Any model that complies with the requirements of 17.5.1.2 and 17.5.2.3 can be used to establish the concrete-related strengths. Additionally, anchor tensile and shear strengths are limited by the minimum spacings and edge distances of 17.9 to preclude splitting. The design of post-installed anchors recognizes that the strength of anchors is sensi- tive to appropriate installation; installation requirements are included in Chapter 26.

Elastic analysis or plastic analysis of ductile anchors as described in 17.2.1 may be used to determine the loads resisted by each anchor.

R17.5.2.1 For conditions where the factored tensile or shear force exceeds the concrete breakout strength of the anchor(s) or if the breakout strength is not evaluated, the nominal strength can be based on properly developed anchor reinforcement as illustrated in Fig. R17.5.2.1a for tension and Fig. R17.5.2.1b(i) and Fig. R17.5.2.1b(ii) for shear. Because anchor reinforcement is placed below where the shear is applied (refer to Fig. R17.5.2.1b), the force in the anchor reinforcement will be larger than the shear force. Anchor reinforcement is distinguished from supplementary reinforcement in that it is designed exclusively for the anchor loads and is intended to preclude concrete breakout. Strut- and-tie models may be used to design anchor reinforcement.

Because development for full fy is required, the use of excess rein- forcement to reduce development length is not permitted for anchor reinforcement. The anchor reinforcement for shear may also consist of stirrups, ties, hoops, or hairpins enclosing the edge reinforcement embedded in the breakout volume and placed as close to the anchors as practicable (refer to Fig. R17.5.2.1b(ii)). Generally, reinforcement spaced less than the smaller of 0.5ca1 and 0.3ca2 from the anchor centerline should be included as anchor reinforcement. In this case, the anchor reinforcement must be developed on both sides of the breakout surface. For equilibrium, edge reinforcement is required. The research on which these provisions are based was limited to anchor reinforcement with maximum diam- eter equivalent to a No. 6 bar.

The resistance of adhesive anchors to sustained tension is particularly dependent on correct installation, including hole cleaning, adhesive metering and mixing, and prevention of voids in the adhesive bond line (annular gap). In addition, care should be taken in the selection of the correct adhesive and bond strength for the expected on-site conditions such as the concrete condition during installation (dry or saturated, cold or hot), the drilling method used (rotary impact drill, rock drill, or core drill), and anticipated in-service temperature variations in the concrete.

Strength reduction factor ࢥ for anchor reinforce- ment shall be 0.75. The 0.55 factor used for the additional calculation for sustained tension is correlated with ACI 355.4 test require- ments and provides satisfactory performance of adhesive anchors under sustained tensile loads in accordance with ACI 355.4. Product evaluation according to ACI 355.4 is based on sustained tensile loads being present for 50 years at a standard temperature of 70°F and 10 years at a temper- ature of 110°F. For longer life spans (for example, greater than 50 years) or higher temperatures, lower factors should be considered. Additional information on use of adhesive anchors for such conditions can be found by consulting with the adhesive manufacturer. Adhesive anchors are particularly sensitive to installation direction and load type. Adhesive anchors installed overhead that resist sustained tension are of concern because previous applications of this type have led to failures (National Trans- portation Safety Board 2007). Other anchor types may be more appropriate for such cases. For adhesive anchors that resist sustained tension in horizontal or upwardly inclined orientations, it is essential to meet test requirements of ACI IRU VHQVLWLYLW\ WR LQVWDOODWLRQ GLUHFWLRQ XVH FHUWL¿HG installers, and require special inspection. Inspection and installation requirements are provided in Chapter 26. R17.5.2.2.1 The check for anchor groups is limited to the highest loaded anchor in the group, analogous to the design for pullout. R17.5.3 The ࢥ-factors for the anchor steel strength in Table 17.5.3(a) are based on using futa to determine the nominal strength of the anchor (refer to 17.6.1 and 17.7.1) rather than fya, as used in the design of reinforced concrete members.

Applications with supplementary reinforcement provide more deformation capacity, permitting the ࢥ-factors to be increased. An explicit design of supplementary reinforce- ment for anchor-related forces is not required; however, the arrangement of supplementary reinforcement should gener- ally conform to that of the anchor reinforcement shown in Fig. R17.5.2.1(a) and R17.5.2.1(b)(i) and (ii). Unlike anchor rein- forcement, full development of supplementary reinforcement beyond the assumed breakout failure plane is not required. For concrete breakout in shear for all anchor types and for brittle concrete failure modes for cast-in anchors, the basic strength reduction factor for brittle concrete failures (ࢥ 0.70) was chosen based on results of probabilistic studies. While this factor is greater than the strength reduction factor of structural plain concrete (ࢥ ), the nominal resistance expressions used in this chapter and in the test requirements are based on the 5 percent fractiles; therefore, ࢥ would be overly conservative.

In no case should (ca,max)/1.5 be taken less than one-third of the maximum spacing between anchors within the group. The limit on hef of at least one- third of the maximum spacing between anchors within the group prevents the use of a calculated strength based on LQGLYLGXDO EUHDNRXW YROXPHV IRU DQ DQFKRU JURXS FRQ¿JXUD- tion. This approach is illustrated in Fig. R17.6.2.1.2. In this example, the proposed limit on the value of hef to be used in calculations where hef = (ca,max)/1.5, results in hef = hƍef = 4 in.

American Concrete Institute – Copyrighted © Material – www.concrete.org PART 4: JOINTS/CONNECTIONS/ANCHORS 261 17 Anchoring CODE COMMENTARY ACI Collection Licensed to: Shannon Banchero Figure R17.7.2.1a shows AVco and the development of Eq. (17.7.2.1.3). AVco is the maximum projected area for a single anchor that approximates the surface area of the full breakout YROXPH IRU DQ DQFKRU XQD൵HFWHG E\ HGJH GLVWDQFH VSDFLQJ or depth of member. Figure R17.7.2.1b shows examples of the projected areas for various single-anchor and multiple- anchor arrangements. AVc approximates the full surface area of the breakout for the particular arrangement of anchors. Because AVc is the total projected area for an anchor group, and AVco is the area for a single anchor, there is no need to include the number of anchors in the equation. As shown in the examples in Fig. R17.7.2.1b of two-anchor groups loaded in shear, when using Eq. (17.7.2.1b) for cases where the anchor spacing s is greater than the edge distance to the near-edge anchor ca1,1, both assumptions for load distribution illustrated in Cases 1 and 2 should be consid- ered. This is because the anchors nearest to the free edge FRXOG IDLO ¿UVW RU WKH HQWLUH JURXS FRXOG IDLO DV D XQLW ZLWK the failure surface originating from the anchors farthest from the edge. For Case 1, the steel shear strength is provided by both anchors. For Case 2, the steel shear strength is provided entirely by the anchor farthest from the edge; no contribu- tion of the anchor near the edge is considered. In addition, checking the near-edge anchor for concrete breakout under service loads is advisable to preclude undesirable cracking at service conditions. If the anchor spacing s is less than the edge distance to the near-edge anchor, the failure surfaces may merge (Eligehausen et al. 2006b) and Case 3 of Fig. R17.7.2.1b may be taken as a conservative approach. If the anchors are welded to a common plate (regardless of anchor spacing s), when the anchor nearest the front edge begins to form a breakout failure, shear is transferred to the VWL൵HU DQG VWURQJHU UHDU DQFKRU )RU WKLV UHDVRQ RQO\ &DVH need be considered, which is consistent with Section 6.5.5 of the PCI Design Handbook (PCI MNL 120). For determi- nation of steel shear strength, it is conservative to consider only the anchor farthest from the edge. However, for anchors having a ratio of s/ca1,1 less than 0.6, both the front and rear anchors may be assumed to resist the shear (Anderson and Meinheit 2007). For ratios of s/ca1,1 greater than 1, it is advis- able to check concrete breakout of the near-edge anchor to preclude undesirable cracking at service conditions. Further discussion of design for multiple anchors is given in Primavera et al. (1997). For anchors near a corner required to resist a shear force with components normal to each edge, a satisfactory solu- tion is to check the connection independently for each component of the shear force. Other specialized cases, such as the shear resistance of anchor groups where all anchors do not have the same edge distance, are treated in Eligehausen et al. (2006a). The detailed provisions of 17.7.2.1(a) apply to the case of shear directed toward an edge. If the shear is directed away from the edge, the strength will usually be governed by 17.7.1 or 17.7.3. The case of shear parallel to an edge (c) For shear parallel to an edge, Vcb or Vcbg shall be permitted to be twice the value of the shear calculated by Eq.

It shall be permitted to evaluate AVc as the base of a truncated half-pyramid projected on the side face of the member where the top of the half-pyramid is given by the axis of the anchor row selected as critical.

Research (Hoehler and Eligehausen 2008; Vintzileou and Eligehausen 1992) has shown that if the steel of the anchor yields before the concrete anchorage fails, no reduc- WLRQ LQ WKH DQFKRU WHQVLOH VWUHQJWK LV QHHGHG IRU HDUWKTXDNH± LQGXFHG IRUFHV 'XFWLOH VWHHO DQFKRUV VKRXOG VDWLVI\ WKH GH¿- nition for steel element, ductile in Chapter 2. To facilitate comparison between steel strength, which is based on the most highly-stressed anchor, and concrete strength based on group behavior, the design is performed on the basis of the ratio of applied load to strength for the steel and concrete, respectively. For some structures, anchors provide the best locations for energy dissipation in the nonlinear range of response.

When an anchor is subject to load reversals, and its yielding length outside the concrete exceeds 6da, buckling of the anchor in compression is likely. Buckling can be restrained by placing the anchor in a tube. However, care must be taken that the tube does not share in resisting the tensile load assumed to act on the anchor. For anchor bolts that are not threaded over their length, it is important to ensure that yielding occurs over the unthreaded portion of the bolt within the stretch length before failure in WKH WKUHDGV 7KLV LV DFFRPSOLVKHG E\ PDLQWDLQLQJ VX൶FLHQW PDUJLQ EHWZHHQ WKH VSHFL¿HG \LHOG DQG WHQVLOH VWUHQJWKV RI the bolt.

The design and detailing requirements should be compat- ible with the level of inelastic response assumed in the calcu- lation of the design earthquake forces.

For any given structural element or system, the terms “ordinary,” “intermediate,” and “special,” refer to increasing requirements for detailing and proportioning, with expectations of increased deformation capacity. Struc- tures assigned to SDC B are not expected to be subjected to strong ground motion, but instead are expected to expe- rience low levels of ground motion at long time intervals. This Code provides some requirements for beam-column ordinary moment frames to improve deformation capacity. Structures assigned to SDC C may be subjected to moder- ately strong ground motion.

ACI ITG-5.1 provides similar information for precast wall systems. The toughness requirement in 18.2.1.7 refers to the requirement to maintain structural integrity of the entire seismic-force-resisting system at lateral displacements anticipated for the maximum considered earthquake motion. Depending on the energy-dissipation characteristics of the structural system used, such displacements may be larger than for a monolithic reinforced concrete structure satisfying the prescriptive provisions of other parts of this Code. R18.2.2 $QDO\VLV DQG SURSRUWLRQLQJ RI VWUXFWXUDO PHPEHUV It is assumed that the distribution of required strength to the various components of a seismic-force-resisting system will be determined from the analysis of a linearly elastic model of the system acted upon by the factored forces, as required by the general building code. If nonlinear response history anal- yses are to be used, base motions should be selected after a detailed study of the site conditions and local seismic history. Because the basis for earthquake-resistant design admits nonlinear response, it is necessary to investigate the stability of the seismic-force-resisting system, as well as its interaction with other structural and nonstructural members, under expected lateral displacements corresponding to maximum considered earthquake ground motion. For lateral displacement calcula- tions, assuming all the structural members to be fully cracked is likely to lead to better estimates of the possible drift than using XQFUDFNHG VWL൵QHVV IRU DOO PHPEHUV 7KH DQDO\VLV DVVXPSWLRQV described in 6.6.3.1 PD\ EH XVHG WR HVWLPDWH ODWHUDO GHÀHFWLRQV of reinforced concrete building systems.

ASTM A706 Grade 80 reinforcement is also permitted in special moment frames. Results of tests and analytical studies presented in NIST (2014) and Sokoli and Ghannoum (2016) indicate that properly detailed beams and columns of special moment frames with ASTM A706 Grade 80 reinforcement exhibit strength and deformation capacities similar to those of members reinforced with Grade 60 reinforcement.

To allow the use of ASTM A706 Grade 80 and 100 rein- forcement, the 2019 Code includes limits for spacing of transverse reinforcement to provide adequate longitudinal bar support to control longitudinal bar buckling. In special moment frames, the use of Grade 80 reinforcement requires increased joint depths to prevent excessive slip of beam bars passing through beam-column joints (18.8.2.3). The requirement for a tensile strength greater than the yield strength of the reinforcement (20.2.2.5, Table 20.2.1.3(b)) is based on the assumption that the capability of a structural member to develop inelastic rotation capacity is a func- tion of the length of the yield region along the axis of the member.

According to this interpretation, the greater the ratio of nominal to yield moment, the longer the yield region. Chapter 20 requires that the ratio of actual tensile strength to actual yield strength be at least 1.25 for ASTM A615 Grade 60. The restrictions on the value of fyt apply to all types of transverse reinforcement, including spirals, circular hoops, rectilinear hoops, and crossties. Research results (Budek et al. 2002; Muguruma and Watanabe 1990; Sugano et al. 1990) indicate that higher yield strengths can be used H൵HFWLYHO\ DV FRQ¿QHPHQW UHLQIRUFHPHQW DV VSHFL¿HG LQ 18.7.5.4. The increases to 80,000 psi and 100,000 psi for shear design of some special seismic system members is based on research indicating the design shear strength can be developed (Wallace 1998; Aoyama 2001; Budek et al. 2002; Sokoli and Ghannoum 2016; Cheng et al. 2016; Huq et al. 2018; Weber-Kamin et al. 2019). The 60,000 psi restriction on the value of fyt for deformed bar in 20.2.2.4 for calcu- lating nominal shear strength is intended to limit the width of shear cracks at service-level loads. Service-level cracking is not a concern in members of the seismic-force-resisting system subjected to design-level earthquake forces.

In previous Codes, any frame member subjected to a factored axial compressive force exceeding (Ag fcƍ ) under any load combination was to be proportioned and detailed as described in 18.7. In the 2014 Code, all requirements for beams are contained in 18.6 regardless of the magnitude of axial compressive force. This Code is written with the assumption that special moment frames comprise horizontal beams and vertical columns interconnected by beam-column joints. It is accept- able for beams and columns to be inclined provided the resulting system behaves as a frame—that is, lateral resis- tance is provided primarily by moment transfer between beams and columns rather than by strut or brace action. In special moment frames, it is acceptable to design beams to resist combined moment and axial force as occurs in beams that act both as moment frame members and as chords or collectors of a diaphragm. It is acceptable for beams of special moment frames to cantilever beyond columns, but such cantilevers are not part of the special moment frame that forms part of the seismic-force-resisting system. It is acceptable for beams of a special moment frame to connect into a wall boundary if the boundary is reinforced as a special moment frame column in accordance with 18.7. A concrete braced frame, in which lateral resistance is provided primarily by axial forces in beams and columns, is not a recognized seismic-force-resisting system. 18.5—Intermediate precast structural walls 18.5.1 Scope 18.5.1.1 This section shall apply to intermediate precast struc- tural walls forming part of the seismic-force-resisting system. 18.5.2 General 18.5.2.1 In connections between wall panels, or between wall panels and the foundation, yielding shall be restricted to steel elements or reinforcement. 18.5.2.2 For elements of the connection that are not designed to yield, the required strength shall be based on 1.5Sy of the yielding portion of the connection. 18.5.2.3 In structures assigned to SDC D, E, or F, wall piers shall be designed in accordance with 18.10.8 or 18.14. 18.6—Beams of special moment frames 18.6.1 Scope 18.6.1.1 This section shall apply to beams of special moment frames that form part of the seismic-force-resisting system and DUH SURSRUWLRQHG SULPDULO\ WR UHVLVW ÀH[XUH DQG VKHDU 18.6.1.2 Beams of special moment frames shall frame into columns of special moment frames satisfying 18.7.

The bond stresses on these straight bars may be very large. To reduce slip substantially during the formation of adjacent beam hinging, it would be necessary to have a ratio of column dimension to bar diameter of approximately 32 for Grade 60 bars, which would result in very large joints. Tests demonstrate adequate behavior if the ratio of joint depth to maximum beam longitudinal bar diameter for Grade 60 rein- forcement is at least 20 for normalweight concrete and 26 for lightweight concrete. A joint depth of 26db for Grade 80 reinforcement is intended to achieve similar performance to that of a joint depth of 20db for Grade 60 reinforcement and normalweight concrete. The limits on joint depth provide reasonable control on the amount of slip of the beam bars in a beam-column joint, considering the number of anticipated inelastic excursions of the building frame during a major earthquake. A thorough treatment of this topic is given in Zhu and Jirsa (1983).

The requirement for distributed shear reinforcement is related to the intent to control the width of inclined cracks. The requirement for two layers of reinforce- ment in walls resisting substantial design shears in 18.10.2.2 is based on the observation that, under ordinary construction conditions, the probability of maintaining a single layer of reinforcement near the middle of the wall section is quite low. Furthermore, presence of reinforcement close to the surface tends to inhibit fragmentation of the concrete in the event of severe cracking during an earthquake. The require- ment for two layers of vertical reinforcement in more slender walls is to improve lateral stability of the compression zone under cyclic loads following yielding of vertical reinforce- ment in tension. R18.10.2.3 Requirements are based on provisions in Chapter 25 ZLWK PRGL¿FDWLRQV WR DGGUHVV LVVXHV VSHFL¿F to structural walls, as well as to the use of high-strength reinforcement. Because actual forces in longitudinal rein- forcement of structural walls may exceed calculated forces, reinforcement should be developed or spliced to reach the yield strength of the bar in tension.

A limit of 12 ft is included for cases with large story heights. Bar termina- tions should be accomplished gradually over a wall height and should not be located close to critical sections where yielding of longitudinal reinforcement is expected, which typically occurs at the base of a wall with a uniform, or nearly uniform, cross section over the building height. Strain hardening of reinforcement results in spread of plasticity away from critical sections as lateral deformations increase.

Where transverse reinforcement is used, development lengths for straight and hooked bars may be reduced as permitted in 25.4.2 and 25.4.3, respectively, because closely spaced transverse rein- forcement improves the performance of splices and hooks subjected to repeated inelastic demands (ACI 408.2R). 18.10.2.1 The distributed web reinforcement ratios, ȡƐ and ȡt, for structural walls shall be at least 0.0025, except that if Vu does not exceed Ȝ ′ cf Acv, ȡt shall be permitted to be reduced to the values in 11.6.

For any one of the individual vertical wall segments, Vn shall not be taken greater than 10 ′ cf Acw, where Acw is the area of concrete section of the individual vertical wall segment considered. 18.10.4.5 For horizontal wall segments and coupling beams, Vn shall not be taken greater than 10 ′ cf Acv, where Acw is the area of concrete section of a horizontal wall segment or coupling beam. R18.10.4 Shear strength Equation (18.10.4.1) recognizes the higher shear strength of walls with high shear-to-moment ratios (Hirosawa 1977; Joint ACI-ASCE Committee 326 1962; Barda et al. 1977). The nominal shear strength is given in terms of the gross area of the section resisting shear, Acv. For a rectangular section without openings, the term Acv refers to the gross area of the cross section rather than to the product of the width and the H൵HFWLYH GHSWK A vertical wall segment refers to a part of a wall bounded horizontally by openings or by an opening and an edge. For DQ LVRODWHG ZDOO RU D YHUWLFDO ZDOO VHJPHQW ȡt refers to hori- zontal reinforcement and ȡƐ refers to vertical reinforcement. The ratio hw/Ɛw may refer to overall dimensions of a wall, or of a segment of the wall bounded by two openings, or an opening and an edge. The intent of 18.10.4.2 is to make certain that any segment of a wall is not assigned a unit strength greater than that for the entire wall. However, a wall segment with a ratio of hw/Ɛw higher than that of the entire wall should be proportioned for the unit strength associated with the ratio hw/Ɛw based on the dimensions for that segment. 7R UHVWUDLQ WKH LQFOLQHG FUDFNV H൵HFWLYHO\ UHLQIRUFHPHQW included in ȡt and ȡƐ should be appropriately distributed along the length and height of the wall (refer to 18.10.4.3).

Within practical limits, shear reinforce- ment distribution should be uniform and at a small spacing. If the factored shear force at a given level in a structure is resisted by several walls or several vertical wall segments of a perforated wall, the average unit shear strength assumed for the total available cross-sectional area is limited to 8 ′ cf with the additional requirement that the unit shear strength assigned to any single vertical wall segment does not exceed 10 ′ cf .

Provision 18.10.6.2 allows the use of displace- ment-based design of walls, in which the structural details are determined directly on the basis of the expected lateral displacements of the wall. The provisions of 18.10.6.3 are similar to those of the 1995 Code, and have been retained because they are conservative for assessing required trans- verse reinforcement at wall boundaries for many walls. Provisions 18.10.6.4 and 18.10.6.5 apply to structural walls designed by either 18.10.6.2 or 18.10.6.3. R18.10.6.2 This section is based on the assumption that LQHODVWLF UHVSRQVH RI WKH ZDOO LV GRPLQDWHG E\ ÀH[XUDO DFWLRQ at a critical, yielding section. The wall should be propor- tioned and reinforced so that the critical section occurs where intended. Equation (18.10.6.2a) follows from a displacement- based approach (Moehle 1992; Wallace and Orakcal 2002).

Consistent with a displacement-based design approach, the design displacement in Eq. (18.10.6.2a) is taken at the top of the wall, and the wall height is taken as the height above the critical section. The multiplier of 1.5 on design displacement was added to Eq. (18.10.6.2) in the 2014 Code to produce detailing requirements more consis- tent with the building code performance intent of a low prob- ability of collapse in Maximum Considered Earthquake level shaking.

The axial load is the factored axial load that is consistent with the design load combination that produces the design displacement įu.

American Concrete Institute – Copyrighted © Material – www.concrete.org 324 ACI 318-19: BUILDING CODE REQUIREMENTS FOR STRUCTURAL CONCRETE CODE COMMENTARY ACI Collection Licensed to: Shannon Banchero Equation (18.10.6.2b) is based on the mean top-of-wall drift capacity at 20 percent loss of lateral strength proposed by Abdullah and Wallace (2019). The requirement that drift capacity exceed 1.5 times the drift demand results in a low probability of strength loss for the design earthquake. The expression for b in (ii) is derived from Eq. (18.10.6.2b), assuming values of Vu/(8Acv ′ cf ) and įu/hwcs of approxi- mately 1.0 and 0.015, respectively. If b varies over c, an average or representative value of b should be used. For H[DPSOH DW WKH ÀDQJHG HQG RI D ZDOO b should be taken equal WR WKH H൵HFWLYH ÀDQJH ZLGWK GH¿QHG LQ XQOHVV c extends into the web, then a weighted average should be used for b. $W WKH HQG RI D ZDOO ZLWKRXW D ÀDQJH b should be taken equal to the wall thickness. If the drift capacity does not exceed the drift demand for a trial design, then changes to the design are required to increase wall drift capacity, reduces wall drift demand, or both, such that drift capacity exceeds drift demand for each wall in a given building. R18.10.6.3 By this procedure, the wall is considered to be acted on by gravity loads and the maximum shear and moment induced by earthquake in a given direction. Under this loading, the compressed boundary at the critical section resists the tributary gravity load plus the compressive resul- tant associated with the bending moment.

For walls with moderate amounts of boundary longitudinal reinforcement, ties are required to inhibit buckling. The longitudinal reinforce- ment ratio is intended to include only the reinforcement at the wall boundary, as indicated in Fig. R18.10.6.5. A greater spacing of ties relative to 18.10.6.4(e) is allowed due to the lower deformation demands on the walls. Requirements of 18.10.6.5 apply over the entire wall height and are summa- rized in Fig. R18.10.6.4c for cases where special boundary elements are required (Moehle et al. 2011). The addition of hooks or U-stirrups at the ends of hori- zontal wall reinforcement provides anchorage so that the UHLQIRUFHPHQW ZLOO EH H൵HFWLYH LQ UHVLVWLQJ VKHDU IRUFHV ,W will also tend to inhibit the buckling of the vertical edge reinforcement. In walls with low in-plane shear, the devel- opment of horizontal reinforcement is not necessary. Limits on spacing of transverse reinforcement are intended to prevent bar buckling until reversed cyclic strains extend well into the inelastic range. To achieve similar performance capability, smaller spacing is required for higher-strength longitudinal reinforcement. h h x a x 14 boundary longitudinal bars Distributed bars Ab ρ = 14Ab h(2x + a) s Distributed bars, Ab, at equal spacing s ρ = 2Ab hs Fig. R18.10.6.52/RQJLWXGLQDO UHLQIRUFHPHQW UDWLRV IRU typical wall boundary conditions.

Therefore, diagonally reinforced coupling beams are restricted to beams having aspect ratio Ɛn/h < 4. The 2008 edition of this Code was changed to clarify that coupling beams of intermediate aspect ratio can be reinforced according to 18.6.3 through 18.6.5. Diagonal bars should be placed approximately symmetri- cally in the beam cross section, in two or more layers. The diagonally placed bars are intended to provide the entire shear and corresponding moment strength of the beam.

Earlier design practice assumed design moments for diaphragms were resisted entirely by chord forces acting at opposite edges of the diaphragm.

R18.12.9 Shear strength The shear strength requirements for diaphragms are similar to those for slender structural walls and are based on the shear provisions for beams.

The FRH൶FLHQW RI IULFWLRQ ȝ, in the shear friction model is taken equal to 1.0 for normalweight concrete due to the presence of these shrinkage cracks.

It is assumed that connections between the precast elements do not contribute to the shear strength of the topping slab diaphragm.

The following discussion provides assistance for selecting the appropriate exposure class for each of the exposure cate- gories. Members are required to be assigned to four exposure classes, one for each exposure category, and are also required to meet the most restrictive requirements of all of these expo- sures. For example, the slabs of a parking garage in a cold climate might be assigned to Exposure Classes F3, S0, W2, and C2, and a potable water tank inside a heated building might be assigned to Exposure Classes F0, S0, W2, and C1. Exposure Category F: Whether concrete is damaged by cycles of freezing and thawing depends on the amount of water in the pores of the concrete at the time of freezing (Powers 1975). The amount of water present may be described in terms of the degree of saturation of the concrete. If the degree of saturation is high enough, there will be VX൶FLHQW ZDWHU LQ WKH FRQFUHWH SRUHV WR SURGXFH LQWHUQDO tensile stresses large enough to cause cracking when the water freezes and expands.

Exposure class varies with degree of exposure to water, DV WKLV ZLOO LQÀXHQFH WKH OLNHOLKRRG WKDW DQ\ SRUWLRQ RI WKH concrete will be saturated when exposed to cyclic freezing and thawing. Conditions that increase the potential for satu- ration include longer-duration or more-frequent contact with water without intervening drainage or drying periods. The likelihood that concrete in a member will be saturated depends on project location, member location and orienta- tion in the structure, and climate. Records of performance of similar members in existing structures in the same general location can also provide guidance in assigning exposure classes. Exposure Category F is subdivided into four exposure classes: (a) Exposure Class F0 is assigned to concrete that will not be exposed to cycles of freezing and thawing. (b) Exposure Class F1 is assigned to concrete that will be exposed to cycles of freezing and thawing and that will have limited exposure to water.

Even though concrete in this exposure class is not expected to become saturated, a minimum entrained air content of 3.5 to 6 percent is required to reduce the potential for damage in case portions of the concrete member become saturated. (c) Exposure Class F2 is assigned to concrete that will be exposed to cycles of freezing and thawing and that will have frequent exposure to water. Frequent exposure to water implies that some portions of the concrete will DEVRUE VX൶FLHQW ZDWHU VXFK WKDW RYHU WLPH WKH\ ZLOO KDYH the potential to be saturated before freezing. If there is doubt about whether to assign Exposure Classes F1 or F2 to a member, the more conservative choice, F2, should be selected. Exposure Classes F1 and F2 are conditions where exposure to deicing chemicals is not anticipated. (d) Exposure Class F3 is assigned to concrete that will be exposed to cycles of freezing and thawing with the same degree of exposure to water as Exposure Class F2. Addi- tionally, concrete in Exposure Class F3 is anticipated to be exposed to deicing chemicals. Deicing chemicals can increase water absorption and retention (Spragg et al. 2011), which would enable the concrete to become satu- rated more readily.

(b) Exposure Classes S1, S2, and S3 are assigned for structural concrete members in direct contact with soluble sulfates in soil or water.

Exposure Classes F1, F2, and F3: In addition to complying with a maximum w/cm limit and a minimum fcƍ, concrete for members subject to freezing-and-thawing exposures is required to be air entrained in accordance with 19.3.3.1. Members assigned to Exposure Class F3 are addi- tionally required to comply with the limitations on the quan- tity of pozzolans and slag cement in the composition of the cementitious materials as given in 26.4.2.2(b). The requirements for plain concrete members in Exposure Class F3 are less restrictive because of the reduced likeli- hood of problems caused by reinforcement corrosion. The licensed design professional should consider the details of the minimal reinforcement to be included in plain concrete members to ensure that the less restrictive requirements are DSSURSULDWH IRU WKH VSHFL¿F SURMHFW Exposure Classes S1, S2, and S3: Table 19.3.2.1 lists the appropriate types of cement and the maximum w/cm and minimum fcƍ for various sulfate exposure conditions. In selecting cement for sulfate resistance, the principal consid- eration is its tricalcium aluminate (C3A) content. 7KH XVH RI À\ DVK ASTM C618, Class F), natural pozzo- lans (ASTM C618, Class N), silica fume (ASTM C1240), or slag cement (ASTM C989) has been shown to improve the sulfate resistance of concrete (Li and Roy 1986; ACI 233R; ACI 234R). Therefore, Footnote [7] to Table 19.3.2.1 provides a performance option to determine the appropriate amounts of these materials to use in combination with the VSHFL¿F FHPHQW W\SHV OLVWHG ASTM C1012 is permitted to be used to evaluate the sulfate resistance of mixtures using combinations of cementitious materials in accordance with 26.4.2.2(c). Some ASTM C595 and ASTM C1157 blended cements can meet the testing requirements of 26.4.2.2.(c) without addition of pozzolans or slag cement to the blended cement as manufactured. Note that sulfate-resisting cement will not increase resis- tance of concrete to some chemically aggressive solutions— for example, sulfuric acid. The construction documents should explicitly cover such cases. In addition to the proper selection of cementitious mate- rials, other requirements for durable concrete exposed to water-soluble sulfates are essential, such as w/cm, strength, consolidation, uniformity, cover of reinforcement, and moist curing to develop the potential properties of the concrete. Exposure Class S1:ASTM C150 Type II cement is limited to a maximum C3A content of 8 percent and is acceptable for use in Exposure Class S1. Blended cements under ASTM C595 with the MS designation, which indicates the cement meets requirements for moderate sulfate resistance, are also appropriate for use. Under ASTM C1157, the appropriate designation for moderate sulfate exposure is Type MS.

Less expansion is produced by a given cement in seawater compared with freshwater with the same sulfate content (ACI 201.2R). Therefore, seawater is included in the same exposure class as solutions with lower sulfate concentrations. Portland cement with C3A up to 10 percent is allowed in concrete mixtures exposed to seawater if the maximum w/cm is limited to 0.40 (refer to the footnote to Table 19.3.2.1). Exposure Class S2: ASTM C150 Type V cement is limited to a maximum C3A content of 5 percent and is accept- able for use in Exposure Class S2. The appropriate binary and ternary blended cements under ASTM C595 include the VX൶[ +6 DV SDUW RI WKHLU GHVLJQDWLRQ ZKLFK LQGLFDWHV WKH cement conforms to requirements for high sulfate resistance.

Exposure Class S3 (Option 1) 7KH EHQH¿W RI WKH DGGL- tion of pozzolan or slag cement allows for a greater w/cm than required for Option 2. The amounts of supplementary cementitious materials are based on records of successful service or testing in accordance with 26.4.2.2(c). Exposure Class S3 (Option 2): This option allows the use of ASTM C150 Type V portland cement meeting the optional limit of 0.040 percent maximum expansion, ASTM C595 ELQDU\ DQG WHUQDU\ EOHQGHG FHPHQWV ZLWK WKH +6 VX൶[ in their designation, and ASTM C1157 Type HS cements without the use of additional pozzolan or slag cement, but it instead requires a lower w/cm than that required for Option 1. This lower w/cm reduces the permeability of the concrete and thus increases sulfate resistance (Lenz 1992). Use of this lower w/cm permits a shorter testing period to qualify the sulfate resistance of a cementitious system in accordance with 26.4.2.2(c). In addition to the proper selection of cementitious mate- rials, other requirements for durable concrete exposed to water-soluble sulfates are essential, such as low w/cm, strength, adequate consolidation, uniformity, adequate cover RI UHLQIRUFHPHQW DQG VX൶FLHQW PRLVW FXULQJ WR GHYHORS WKH potential properties of the concrete.

The Code (26.4.2.2(d)) prohibits the use of aggregates that are alkali-carbonate reactive. Exposure Class W2: This exposure class requires low concrete permeability. The primary means to obtain a concrete with low permeability is to reduce w/cm. For a given w/FP, permeability can be reduced by optimizing the cementitious materials used in the concrete mixture. American Concrete Institute – Copyrighted © Material – www.concrete.org PART 6: MATERIALS & DURABILITY 363 CODE COMMENTARY 19 Concrete ACI Collection Licensed to: Shannon Banchero In addition, because of the exposure to water, the Code (26.4.2.2(d)) has a requirement to demonstrate that aggre- gates used in concrete are not alkali reactive according to ASTM C1778.

Exposure Class C2: For nonprestressed and prestressed concrete in Exposure Class C2, the maximum w/cm, PLQLPXP VSHFL¿HG FRPSUHVVLYH VWUHQJWK DQG PLQLPXP cover are the basic requirements to be considered. Condi- tions should be evaluated for structures exposed to chlo- rides, such as in parking structures where chlorides may be tracked in by vehicles, or in structures near seawater. Coated reinforcement, corrosion-resistant steel reinforce- ment, and cover greater than the minimum required in 20.5 can provide additional protection under such conditions. Use of slag cement meeting ASTM C989 RU À\ DVK PHHWLQJ ASTM C618 DQG LQFUHDVHG OHYHOV RI VSHFL¿HG FRPSUHVVLYH strength provide increased protection. Use of silica fume meeting ASTM C1240 with an appropriate high-range water reducer, ASTM C494, Types F and G, or ASTM C1017 can also provide additional protection (Ozyildirim and Halstead 1988). The use of ASTM C1202 to test concrete mixtures proposed for use will provide additional information on the performance of the mixtures. Chloride limits for Exposure Category C: For Exposure Classes C0, C1, and C2, the chloride ion limits apply to the chlorides contributed from the concrete materials, not from the environment surrounding the concrete. Even for Expo- sure Class C0, water-soluble chlorides introduced from the concrete materials can potentially induce corrosion of the reinforcement and must be limited for both nonprestressed and prestressed concrete, regardless of external expo- sure. For nonprestressed concrete, the permitted maximum amount of water-soluble chloride ions incorporated into the concrete, depends on the degree of exposure to an anticipated external source of moisture and chlorides. For prestressed concrete, the same limit of 0.06 percent chloride ion by mass of cementitious material applies regardless of exposure. The limits on chloride ion content for prestressed concrete are reduced from those for nonprestressed concrete because corrosion of prestressed reinforcement generally has more severe consequences than corrosion of nonpre- stressed reinforcement. Corrosion-induced reduction in the cross-sectional area of the prestressed reinforcement may result in fracture of the steel (ACI 222R). The presence of chloride ions may cause corrosion of embedded aluminum such as conduits, especially if the aluminum is in contact with embedded steel and the concrete is in a humid environ- ment. Requirements for protecting aluminum embedments from corrosion are given in 20.6.3 and 26.8.2. Allowable chloride limits are based on the mass of total cementitious materials rather than portland cement alone. 7KLV FKDQJH ZDV PDGH LQ $&, WR UHÀHFW ¿QGLQJV WKDW American Concrete Institute – Copyrighted © Material – www.concrete.org 364 ACI 318-19: BUILDING CODE REQUIREMENTS FOR STRUCTURAL CONCRETE CODE COMMENTARY ACI Collection Licensed to: Shannon Banchero GHPRQVWUDWH WKH EHQH¿FLDO H൵HFWV RI VXSSOHPHQWDU\ FHPHQWL- tious materials (SCMs) in reducing permeability and binding chlorides, thus helping to inhibit corrosion (Kosmatka and Wilson 2016 %HFDXVH WKHUH DUH GLPLQLVKLQJ H൵HFWV ZLWK increasing amounts of SCMs, the Code limits the mass of SCMs to 50 percent of the total cementitious materials that can be used to calculate the allowable amount of chloride ions in concrete (Tepke et al. 2016). $GGLWLRQDO LQIRUPDWLRQ RQ WKH H൵HFWV RI FKORULGHV RQ WKH corrosion of steel reinforcement is given in ACI 201.2R, which provides guidance on concrete durability, and ACI 222R, which provides guidance on factors that impact corro- sion of metals in concrete.

The use of ASTM C457 for quality control during construction is not practical. Although there are no standard tests for air content of dry-mix shotcrete during construc- tion, there are industry accepted methods for testing. These methods involve obtaining samples of dry-mix shotcrete and performing standard tests such as ASTM C231 to determine air content. Field measurements of air content of dry-mix shotcrete have been obtained by shooting the material directly into a bowl of an air meter (Betrand and Vezina 1994). Samples for air content testing can also be taken from material shot into test panels, into a wheelbarrow, or onto the ground. These samples can then be used for testing in accordance with ASTM C231 (Zhang 2015).

ASTM A1035 provides requirements for bars of two minimum yield strength levels—100,000 psi and 120,000 psi—designated as Grade 100 and Grade 120, respectively, but the maximum fyt permitted for design calculations in this Code is limited in accordance with 20.2.2.3. In 2015, ASTM A615 included bar sizes larger than No. 18, and in 2016, ASTM A1035 also included bar sizes larger than No. 18. Bar sizes larger than No. 18 are not permitted by this Code due to the lack of information on their perfor- mance including bar bends and development lengths.

R20.2.1.6 The limitation to Class HA head dimensions from Annex A1 of ASTM A970 is due to a lack of test data for headed deformed bars that do not meet Class HA dimensional requirements. Heads not conforming to Class HA limits on bar deformation obstructions and bearing face features have been shown to provide lower anchorage strength than the heads used in the tests that serve as the basis for 25.4.4 (Shao et al. 2016). R20.2.1.7 Plain wire is permitted only for spiral reinforce- ment and in welded plain wire reinforcement, the latter of which is considered deformed. Stainless steel wire and stain- less steel welded wire reinforcement are used in applications where high corrosion resistance or controlled magnetic permeability is required. The physical and mechanical property requirements for deformed stainless steel wire and deformed and plain welded wire reinforcement under ASTM A1022 are the same as those for deformed wire, deformed welded wire reinforcement, and plain welded wire reinforce- ment under ASTM A1064. R20.2.1.7.1 An upper limit is placed on the size of deformed wire because tests (Rutledge and Devries 2002) have shown that D45 wire will achieve only approximately 60 percent of the bond strength in tension given by Eq.

In Table 20.2.2.4(a), for deformed reinforcement in special moment frames and special structural walls, the use of longi- tudinal reinforcement with strength substantially higher than that assumed in design will lead to higher shear and bond stresses at the time of development of yield moments.

The limit of 60,000 psi on the values of fy and fyt used in design for most shear and torsional reinforcement is intended to control the width of inclined cracks under service-level gravity loads. The higher yield strength of 80,000 psi permitted in shear design for welded deformed wire reinforcement is also intended to control width of inclined cracks and is based on Guimares et al. (1992), Griezic et al. (1994), and Furlong et al. (1991). In particular, full-scale beam tests described in Griezic et al. (1994) indicated that the widths of inclined shear cracks at service load levels were less for beams reinforced with smaller diameter welded deformed wire reinforcement cages designed on the basis of a yield strength of 75,000 psi than beams reinforced with deformed Grade 60 stirrups. )RU VWUHQJWK OHYHO HDUWKTXDNH ORDG H൵HFWV WHVWV RI PHPEHUV using higher strength reinforcement have shown acceptable behavior (Wallace 1998; Aoyama 2001; Budek et al. 2002; Sokoli and Ghannoum 2016; Cheng et al. 2016; Huq et al. 2018; Weber-Kamin et al. 2019), leading to the allowance of ASTM A706 Grade 80 reinforcement for special seismic systems and ASTM A706 Grade 100 for special structural walls in the 2019 Code, as indicated in Table 20.2.2.4(a). Footnote [6] of Table 20.2.2.4(a) is provided because ASTM A1064 and A1022 only require the welds to develop 35,000 psi in the interconnected wires. Hoops, stirrups, and other elements used in special seismic systems should have anchorages that are capable of developing 1.25fy or 1.25fyt, as applicable, or tensile strength of the bar or wire, whichever is less, so that moderate ductility capacity can be achieved. A welded product that is capable of developing these stress limits could be approved for use through Code Section 1.10. Footnote [3] of Table 20.2.2.4(a) limiting slab and beam bars passing through or extending from special structural walls to reinforcement meeting 20.2.2.5 provides for greater ductility of these members that are not designated as part of the seismic-force-resisting system but are likely to undergo large nonlinear rotational demands. The 80,000 psi limit on fy for ties of members or regions of members designed using the strut-and-tie method is imposed because of scarcity of test data justifying a higher limit. The yield strength fy of “other” ties is limited to 60,000 psi for consistency with the usage “shear.” American Concrete Institute – Copyrighted © Material – www.concrete.org PART 6: MATERIALS & DURABILITY 375 CODE COMMENTARY 20 Reinforcement ACI Collection Licensed to: Shannon Banchero Table 20.2.2.4(a)—Nonprestressed deformed reinforcement Usage Application Maximum value of fy or fyt permitted for design calculations, psi $SSOLFDEOH $670 VSHFL¿FDWLRQ Deformed bars Deformed wires Welded wire reinforcement Welded deformed bar mats Flexure; axial force; and shrinkage and temperature Special seismic systems Special moment frames 80,000 A706[2] Not permitted Not permitted Not permitted Special structural walls[1] 100,000 Other 100,000[3] [4] A615, A706, A955, A996, A1035 A1064, A1022 A1064, A1022 A184[5] Lateral support of longitudinal bars; or concrete FRQ¿QHPHQW Special seismic systems 100,000 A615, A706, A955, A996, A1035 A1064, A1022 A1064[6], A1022[6] Not permitted Spirals 100,000 A615, A706, A955, A996, A1035 A1064, A1022 Not permitted Not permitted Other 80,000 A615, A706, A955, A996 A1064, A1022 A1064, A1022 Not permitted Shear Special seismic systems[7] Special moment frames[8] 80,000 A615, A706, A955, A996 A1064, A1022 A1064[6], A1022[6] Not permitted Special structural walls[9] 100,000 Spirals 60,000 A615, A706, A955, A996 A1064, A1022 Not permitted Not permitted Shear friction 60,000 A615, A706, A955, A996 A1064, A1022 A1064, A1022 Not permitted Stirrups, ties, hoops 60,000 A615, A706, A955, A996, A1035 A1064, A1022 A1064 and A1022 welded plain wire Not permitted 80,000 Not permitted Not permitted A1064 and A1022 welded deformed wire Not permitted Torsion Longitudinal and transverse 60,000 A615, A706, A955, A996 A1064, A1022 A1064, A1022 Not permitted Anchor reinforcement Special seismic systems 80,000 A706[2] Not permitted Not permitted Not permitted Other 80,000 A615, A706, A955, A996 A1064, A1022 A1064, A1022 A184[5] Regions designed using strut-and-tie method Longitudinal ties 80,000 A615, A706, A955, A996 A1064, A1022 A1064, A1022 Not permitted Other 60,000 [1]All components of special structural walls, including coupling beams and wall piers.

R20.2.2.5 The requirement for the tensile strength to be greater than the yield strength of the reinforcement by a factor of 1.25 is based on the assumption that the capa- bility of a structural member to develop inelastic rotation capacity is a function of the length of the yield region along the axis of the member. In interpreting experimental results, the length of the yield region has been related to the rela- tive magnitudes of probable and yield moments (ACI 352R). According to this interpretation, the greater the ratio of prob- able-to-yield moment, the longer the yield region.

R22.5.1.8 Consideration of axial tension requires engi- neering judgment. Axial tension often occurs due to volume changes, but it may be low enough not to be detrimental to the performance of a structure with adequate expansion joints and satisfying minimum longitudinal reinforcement requirements. It may be desirable to design shear reinforce- ment to resist the total shear if there is uncertainty about the magnitude of axial tension.

For symmetrically reinforced circular sections, nominal one-way shear strength about any axis is the same. Therefore, when a circular section is subjected to shear along two centroidal axes, shear strength can be evaluated using the resultant shear. However, for rectangular and other cross sections, calculating nominal one-way shear strength along the axis of the resultant shear is not practical. Tests and analytical results for columns have indicated that for biaxial shear loading, the shear strength follows an elliptical inter- action diagram that requires calculating nominal one-way shear strength along two orthogonal directions (Umehara American Concrete Institute – Copyrighted © Material – www.concrete.org 402 ACI 318-19: BUILDING CODE REQUIREMENTS FOR STRUCTURAL CONCRETE CODE COMMENTARY ACI Collection Licensed to: Shannon Banchero 22.5.1.11 If , , 0.5 X [ Q [ v v > φ and , , 0.5 u y n y v v > φ then Eq.

Strength ACI Collection Licensed to: Shannon Banchero R22.7—Torsional strength The design for torsion in this section is based on a thin- walled tube space truss analogy. A beam subjected to torsion is idealized as a thin-walled tube with the core concrete cross section in a solid beam neglected as shown in Fig. R22.7(a). Once a reinforced concrete beam has cracked in torsion, its torsional strength is provided primarily by closed stirrups and longitudinal bars located near the surface of the member. In the thin-walled tube analogy, the strength is assumed to be provided by the outer skin of the cross section roughly centered on the closed stirrups. Both hollow and solid sections are idealized as thin-walled tubes both before and after cracking. In a closed thin-walled tube, the product of the shear stress IJ and the wall thickness t at any point in the perimeter is NQRZQ DV WKH VKHDU ÀRZ q IJt 7KH VKHDU ÀRZ q due to torsion acts as shown in Fig. R22.7(a) and is constant at all points around the perimeter of the tube.

The concrete contribution to torsional strength is ignored, and in cases of combined shear and torsion, the concrete contribution to shear strength does not need to be reduced. The design procedure is derived and compared with test results in MacGregor and Ghoneim (1995) and Hsu (1997). where Av is the sum of the area of all shear studs on one peripheral line that is geometrically similar to the perimeter of the column section, and s is the spacing of the periph- eral lines of headed shear stud reinforcement in the direction perpendicular to the column face. 22.6.8.3 If headed shear stud reinforcement is provided, Av/s shall satisfy: 2 v o c yt A b f s f ≥ ′ (22.6.8.3) 22.7—Torsional strength American Concrete Institute – Copyrighted © Material – www.concrete.org 420 ACI 318-19: BUILDING CODE REQUIREMENTS FOR STRUCTURAL CONCRETE CODE COMMENTARY ACI Collection Licensed to: Shannon Banchero (a) Thin-walled tube (b) Area enclosed by shear flow path Shear flow (q) T T Fig. R22.72 D 7KLQ ZDOOHG WXEH DQG E DUHD HQFORVHG E\ VKHDU ÀRZ SDWK R22.7.1 General R22.7.1.1 Torsional moments that do not exceed the threshold torsion Tth ZLOO QRW FDXVH D VWUXFWXUDOO\ VLJQL¿- FDQW UHGXFWLRQ LQ HLWKHU ÀH[XUDO RU VKHDU VWUHQJWK DQG FDQ be ignored.

This type of torsion is referred to as equilibrium torsion because the torsional moment is required for the structure to be in equilibrium. For this condition, illustrated in Fig. R22.7.3(a), torsional reinforcement must be provided to resist the total design torsional moments. (b) The torsional moment can be reduced by redistribution of internal forces after cracking (22.7.3.2) if the torsion results from the member twisting to maintain compat- ibility of deformations. This type of torsion is referred to as compatibility torsion. For this condition, illustrated in Fig. R22.7.3(b), the WRUVLRQDO VWL൵QHVV EHIRUH FUDFNLQJ FRUUHVSRQGV WR WKDW RI the uncracked section according to St. Venant’s theory. At torsional cracking, however, a large twist occurs under an essentially constant torsional moment, resulting in a large redistribution of forces in the structure (Collins and Lampert 1973; Hsu and Burton 1974). The cracking torsional moment under combined shear, moment, and torsion corresponds to a principal tensile stress somewhat less than the Ȝ ′ cf used in R22.7.5. If the torsional moment exceeds the cracking torsional moment (22.7.3.2), a maximum factored torsional moment equal to the cracking torsional moment may be assumed to occur at the critical sections near the faces of the supports.

Cracking is assumed to occur when the prin- cipal tensile stress reaches Ȝ ′ cf . The stress at cracking, Ȝ ′ cf , has purposely been taken as a lower bound value. In a nonprestressed beam loaded with torsion alone, the principal tensile stress is equated to the torsional shear stress, IJ T/(2Aot). Thus, cracking occurs when IJ reaches 4Ȝ ′ cf , giving the cracking torsional moment Tcr DV GH¿QHG E\ H[SUHVVLRQ D LQ Table 22.7.5.1. For prestressed members, the torsional cracking load is increased by the prestress given by expression (b) in Table 22.7.5.1.

The sum of these stresses may not exceed the stress causing shear cracking plus 8 ′ cf , similar to the limiting strength given in 22.5.1.2 for shear without torsion. The limit is expressed in terms of Vc to allow its use for nonprestressed or prestressed concrete. It was originally derived on the basis of crack control. It is not necessary to check against crushing of the web because crushing occurs at higher shear stresses. In a hollow section, the shear stresses due to shear and torsion both occur in the walls of the box as shown in Fig. R22.7.7.1(a) and hence are directly additive at Point A as given in Eq.

Successful application of this section depends on proper selection of the location of an assumed crack (PCI MNL 120; Birkeland and Birkeland 1966). R22.9.1.2 The relationship between shear-transfer strength and the reinforcement crossing the shear plane can be expressed in various ways. Equations (22.9.4.2) and (22.9.4.3) are based on the shear-friction model and provide a conservative estimate of the shear-transfer strength. Other relationships that provide a more accurate estimate of shear-transfer strength can be used under the requirements of this section. Examples of such procedures can be found in the PCI Design Handbook (PCI MNL 120), Mattock et al. (1976b), and Mattock (1974).

For this reason, discontinuity regions are assumed to extend a distance h from the section where the load or change in geometry occurs.

Figures R23.2.2(a) and (b) show a node and the corresponding nodal zone. The vertical and horizontal forces equilibrate the forces in the inclined strut. If more than three forces act on a nodal zone in a two- dimensional strut-and-tie model, as shown in Fig. R23.2.2b, it is suggested to resolve some of the forces to form three intersecting forces. The strut forces acting on Faces A-E and C-E in Fig. R23.2.2(a) can be replaced with one force acting on Face A-C as shown in Fig. R23.2.2(b). This force passes through the node at D. Alternatively, the strut-and-tie model can be analyzed assuming all the strut forces act through the node at D, as shown in Fig. R23.2.2(c). In this case, the forces in the two struts on the right side of Node D can be resolved into a single force acting through Point D, as shown in Fig. R23.2.2(d). If the width of the support in the direction perpendicular to the member is less than the width of the member, transverse reinforcement may be required to restrain vertical splitting in the plane of the node. This can be modeled using a trans- verse strut-and-tie model. R23.2.3 The analysis results from the strut-and-tie method represent lower-bound strength limit states. Section 23.5.1 requires distributed reinforcement in D-regions designed by this chapter unless struts are laterally restrained. Distrib- uted reinforcement in D-regions will improve service- ability performance. In addition, crack widths in a tie can be controlled using 24.3.2, assuming the tie is encased in a prism of concrete corresponding to the area of the tie from R23.8.1.

R24.3.2 The spacing of reinforcement is limited to control cracking (Beeby 1979; Frosch 1999; ACI Committee 318 1999). For the case of beams with Grade 60 reinforcement and 2 in. clear cover to the primary reinforcement, with fs = 40,000 psi, the maximum bar spacing is 10 in. Crack widths in structures are highly variable. The Code provisions for spacing are intended to limit surface cracks to a width that is generally acceptable in practice but may vary widely in a given structure. The role of cracks in the corrosion of reinforcement is controversial. Research (Darwin et al. 1985; Oesterle 1997) shows that corrosion is not clearly correlated with surface crack widths in the range normally found with reinforcement stresses at service load levels.

Develop- ment lengths are required because of the tendency of highly stressed bars to split relatively thin sections of restraining concrete. A single bar embedded in a mass of concrete should not require as great a development length, although a row of bars, even in mass concrete, can create a weakened plane with longitudinal splitting along the plane of the bars. In application, the development length concept requires minimum lengths or extensions of reinforcement beyond all points of peak stress in the reinforcement. Such peak stresses generally occur at the points of maximum stress and points where reinforcement is bent or terminated. From a point of peak stress in reinforcement, some length of reinforcement or anchorage is necessary to develop the stress. This devel- opment length or anchorage is necessary on both sides of such peak stress points. Often, the reinforcement continues for a considerable distance on one side of a critical stress point so that calculations need involve only the other side, for example, the negative moment reinforcement continuing through a support to the middle of the next span. The requirement for a minimum value of Ktr along development and splice lengths in 9.7.1.4, 10.7.1.3, 25.4.2.2, and 25.5.1.5 improves ductility.

In Table 25.4.2.3, Ɛd is based on two preselected values of (cb + Ktr)/db, whereas Ɛd from Eq. (25.4.2.4a) is based on the actual (cb + Ktr)/db. Although there is no requirement for transverse reinforce- ment along the tension development or lap splice length, research (Azizinamini et al. 1999a,b) indicates that in concrete with very high compressive strength, brittle anchorage failure may occur for bars with inadequate transverse reinforcement. In lap splice tests of No. 8 and No. 11 bars in concrete with an fcƍ of approximately 15,000 psi, transverse reinforcement improved ductile anchorage behavior. R25.4.2.3 This provision recognizes that many current practical construction cases use spacing and cover values DORQJ ZLWK FRQ¿QLQJ UHLQIRUFHPHQW VXFK DV VWLUUXSV RU WLHV that result in a value of (cb + Ktr)/db of at least 1.5. Exam- ples include a minimum clear cover of db along with either minimum clear spacing of 2db, or a combination of minimum clear spacing of db and minimum ties or stirrups. For these frequently occurring cases, the development length for larger bars can be taken as Ɛd = [fyȥtȥeȥg Ȝ ′ cf )]db. In the formulation of the provisions in ACI 318-95, a compar- ison with past provisions and a check of a database of exper- imental results maintained by ACI 408.1R indicated that for No. 6 deformed bars and smaller, as well as for deformed wire, the development lengths could be reduced 20 percent using ȥs = 0.8. This is the basis for the 1R DQG VPDOOHU EDUV DQG GHIRUPHG ZLUHV column of Table 25.4.2.3. With less cover and in the absence of minimum ties or stirrups, the minimum clear spacing limits of 25.2.1 and the minimum concrete cover requirements of 20.5.1.3 result in minimum values of cb equal to db.

The current expression includes only the area and spacing of the trans- verse reinforcement and the number of wires or bars being developed or lap spliced because tests demonstrate that transverse reinforcement rarely yields during a bond failure (Azizinamini et al. 1995).

In contrast, Chapter 17 anchorage provisions describe cases in which the force in the bar is transferred through bearing to the concrete at the head alone. Headed bars are limited to those types that meet the criteria in 20.2.1.6 for Class HA heads. The provisions for headed deformed bars were formulated with due consideration of the provisions for anchorage in Chapter 17 (Shao et al. 2016). Chapter 17 contains provisions for headed anchors related to the individual failure modes of concrete breakout, side-face blowout, and pullout. These failure modes were considered in the formulation of 25.4.4.2. The restrictions to maximum bar size of No. 11 and normal- weight concrete are based on a lack of data for larger bars or lightweight concrete (Thompson et al. 2005, 2006a,b; Shao et al. 2016). The upper limit of 60,000 psi on fy that appeared prior to the 2019 Code has been removed. For bars in tension, heads allow the bars to be developed in a shorter length than required for standard hooks, but otherwise perform in a similar manner (Thompson et al. 2005, 2006a,b; Shao et al. 2016). The head is considered to be part of the bar IRU WKH SXUSRVHV RI VDWLVI\LQJ WKH VSHFL¿HG FRYHU UHTXLUHPHQWV in 20.5.1.3 and aggregate size requirements of 26.4.2.1(a)(5). Headed bars with Abrg < 4Ab have been used in practice, but their performance is not accurately represented by the provisions in 25.4.4.2, and they should be used only with designs that are supported by test results under 25.4.5. These provisions do not address the design of studs or headed stud assemblies used for shear reinforcement. R25.4.4.2 The provisions for developing headed deformed bars give the length of bar, Ɛdt, measured from the critical section to the bearing face of the head, as shown in Fig. R25.4.4.2a. The provisions are primarily based on tests of simulated beam-column joints (Shao et al. 2016). If longitudinal headed deformed bars from a beam, slab, or corbel terminate in a supporting member, such as the column shown in Fig. R25.4.4.2b, the bars should extend WKURXJK WKH MRLQW WR WKH IDU IDFH RI WKH FRQ¿QHG FRUH RI WKH American Concrete Institute – Copyrighted © Material – www.concrete.org PART 8: REINFORCEMENT 477 CODE COMMENTARY 25 Detailing ACI Collection Licensed to: Shannon Banchero supporting member, allowing for cover and avoidance of interference with column reinforcement, even though the resulting anchorage length may exceed Ɛdt. Extending the bar to the far side of the column core helps engage the entire joint in resisting the anchorage forces and thereby improves the performance of the joint. If closely spaced headed bars are used, the potential for concrete breakout failure exists. For joints as shown in Fig. R25.4.4.2c and R25.4.4.2d, anchorage strengths will be generally higher if the anchorage length is equal to or greater than d/1.5 (Eligehausen 2006b), as shown in Fig. R25.4.4.2c, or by providing reinforcement in the form of hoops and ties to establish a load path in accordance with strut-and-tie modeling principles, as shown in Fig. R25.4.4.2d.

Note that the strut-and-tie models illustrated in Fig. R25.4.4.2c and R25.4.4.2d rely on a vertical strut from a column extending above the joint. Beam-column joints at roof-level and portal frames are vulnerable to joint failure and should be properly detailed to restrain diagonal cracking through the joint and breakout of the bars through the top surface. For cases where development length cannot be designed in accordance with 25.4.4.2, use of the provisions of Chapter 17 should be considered. ≥ ldt Critical section Fig. R25.4.4.2a2'HYHORSPHQW RI KHDGHG GHIRUPHG EDUV American Concrete Institute – Copyrighted © Material – www.concrete.org 478 ACI 318-19: BUILDING CODE REQUIREMENTS FOR STRUCTURAL CONCRETE CODE COMMENTARY ACI Collection Licensed to: Shannon Banchero > ldt Bearing face of head Fig. R25.4.4.2b—Headed deformed bar extended to far side of column core with anchorage length that exceeds Ɛdt.

Bonded tie-back reinforcement parallel to the tendon is required in the immediate vicinity of the anchorage to limit the extent of cracking behind the anchorage. The requirement of 0.35Ppu was derived using 25 percent of the unfactored prestressing force being resisted by reinforcement at 0.6fy considering a load factor of 1.2. Therefore, the full yield strength of the reinforcement, fy, should be used in calculating the provided capacity. R25.9.4.4.5 The spalling force for tendons for which the centroid lies within the kern of the section may be estimated as 2 percent of the total factored prestressing force, except for multiple anchorage devices with center-to-center spacing greater than 0.4 times the depth of the section. 25.9.4.4.3 For anchorage devices located away from the end of the member, bonded reinforcement shall be provided to transfer at least 0.35Ppu into the concrete section behind the anchor.

(1994) DQG FRQ¿UPHG based on analysis of other test results by Roberts-Wollmann and Wollmann (2008). Typical details are shown in Fig. R25.9.4.4.6. For slabs not thicker than 8 in., with groups of anchors requiring hairpins, the bars parallel to the loaded face can satisfy 25.9.4.4.6(a) and also provide anchorage for the hairpin bars. Thicker slabs require two bars for 25.9.4.4.6 (a) and two additional bars to provide anchorage for the hairpins in accordance with 25.7.1.2. The horizontal bars parallel to the edge required by 25.9.4.4.6(a) should be continuous where possible. The tests on which the recommendations of Breen et al. (1994) were based were limited to anchorage devices for LQ GLDPHWHU *UDGH VWUDQG DQG XQERQGHG WHQGRQV LQ normalweight concrete. For larger strand anchorage devices or for use in lightweight concrete slabs, ACI Committee 423 recommends that the amount and spacing of reinforcement should be conservatively adjusted to provide for the larger anchorage force and smaller splitting tensile strength of lightweight concrete (ACI 423.3R). ACI 423.3R and Breen et al. (1994) both recommend that hairpin bars also be furnished for anchorages located within 12 in. of slab corners to resist edge tension forces.

Because maximum aggregate size can impact concrete prop- erties such as shrinkage, and also the cost of concrete, the largest aggregate size consistent with the requirements of 26.4.2.1 should be permitted. Increasing aggregate size will only decrease shrinkage if there is a concurrent reduction in paste volume.

As noted in ASTM C1778, alkali-aggregate reaction (AAR) can occur between the alkali hydroxides in the pore solution of concrete and certain components found in some aggregates. Two types of AAR are recognized depending on the nature of the reactive component: alkali-silica reac- tion (ASR), which involves various types of reactive sili- ceous minerals; and alkali-carbonate reaction (ACR), which involves certain types of aggregates that contain dolomite. Both types of reaction can result in expansion and cracking of concrete elements under prolonged exposure to moisture, leading to a reduction in the structural strength and service life of a concrete structure. Options for mitigating ASR, including use of supplementary cementitious materials or limiting alkali content of the concrete, are provided in ASTM C1778. ACR can only be prevented by not using the reactive aggregate. R26.4.2.1(a)(14 and 15) Equilibrium density is an esti- mate of the density of lightweight concrete assuming some degree of drying after initial construction. The equilibrium density of lightweight concrete is determined in accordance with ASTM C567. Acceptance of lightweight concrete at the time of delivery is based on a fresh density determined by the concrete supplier that has been correlated with the equilibrium density. The range of fresh densities can vary based on variations in moisture and air content, mixture proportion, and type of lightweight aggregate, and should be considered when establishing the fresh density that will result in the required equilibrium density. Acceptance of lightweight concrete based on density as well as strength is necessary because the value of Ȝ and self-weight used for design is a function of equilibrium density.

Total chloride ion content of admixtures is reported by the supplier. Calcu- lated total chloride ion content determined in this manner is conservative. If calculated total chloride ion content exceeds the limits in Table 19.3.2.1, the concrete materials can be adjusted until compliance is achieved, or water-soluble chlo- ride ion content can be determined using 26.4.2.2(e)(2). R26.4.2.2(e)(2) This option is to determine the water-soluble chloride ion content in hardened concrete by ASTM C1218 and is an alternative to 26.4.2.2(e)(1) if the total chloride ion content calculated in accordance with 26.4.2.2(e)(1) exceeds the limits of Table 19.3.2.1. The chloride ions present in the pore water solution impact the corrosion of reinforcement or embedded metal. To estimate the water-soluble chloride ion content in the concrete that can impact corrosion, ASTM C1218 is used after a period of hydration. The chlorides in some materials, like aggregates, are not available as water-soluble chlorides. Furthermore, some chlorides initially in solution will be bound by hydration of cementitious materials. Chlorides insoluble in water are not considered to accelerate corrosion of embedded metals. R26.4.2.2(g) The contractor might select a construction option not shown in the construction documents. Because of the critical nature of placements against stay-in-place galvanized steel forms, the Code requires a more stringent chloride ion limit than what may be shown in the construc- tion documents. For example, if a member was originally VSHFL¿HG LQ WKH FRQVWUXFWLRQ GRFXPHQWV ZLWK D FKORULGH OLPLW of 1.00 percent, use of stay-in-place galvanized steel forms results in a change to the more stringent limit of 0.30 percent. R26.4.2.2(h) ASTM C567 provides two methods for determining equilibrium density. To measure equilibrium density, specimens are maintained at 73°F and 50 percent relative humidity until they achieve constant mass. This measurement can take in excess of 2 months. Alternatively, the calculated equilibrium density can be more rapidly estimated from the oven-dry density. The licensed design professional can require the measurement of equilibrium density in accordance with ASTM C567.

Further, this information is available in other ACI documents, such as ACI 301 and ACI 214R. Finally, the quality control proce- dures of some concrete producers allow meeting the accep- tance criteria of the Code without following the process included in previous editions of the Code. R26.4.3.1(a) This section provides requirements for developing mixture proportions. The concrete is required to be workable and to meet the durability and strength requirements of the Code. The term “without segregation” is intended to provide for a cohesive mixture in which aggre- gates remain well distributed while the concrete is in its fresh state. It is recognized that some segregation in the form of bleeding will occur. The required workability will depend on reinforcement congestion, member geometry, and the placement and consolidation methods to be used. Construc- tion requirements of the contractor should be considered in establishing required workability of the concrete. The Code does not include provisions for especially severe exposures, such as chemical contact, high tempera- tures, temporary freezing-and-thawing conditions during construction, abrasive conditions, or other unique durability considerations pertinent to the structure.

R26.5.2.1(c) The Code requires the equipment for handling and transporting concrete to be capable of supplying concrete to the place of deposit continuously and reliably under all conditions and for all methods of placement. This applies to all placement methods, including pumps, belt conveyors, pneumatic systems, wheelbarrows, buggies, crane buckets, and tremies. R26.5.2.1(d) Loss of strength can result if concrete is pumped through pipe made of aluminum or aluminum alloy. This loss is caused by the formation of hydrogen gas generated by the reaction between the cement alkalies and the aluminum eroded from the interior of the pipe surface. The strength reduction has been shown to be as much as 50 percent (Newlon and Ozol 1969). Hence, equipment made of aluminum or aluminum alloys should not be used for pump lines, tremies, or chutes other than short chutes such as those used to convey concrete from a truck mixer. R26.5.2.1(e) Concrete should be available at a supply rate consistent with the capacity of the placement equipment and the placement crew. Concrete supplied at a faster rate than can be accommodated by placement equipment or crew can result in loss of workability of concrete in equipment waiting to discharge. Excessive delays in the supply of concrete can FDXVH SUHYLRXV SODFHPHQWV WR VWL൵HQ DQG UHVXOW LQ WKH IRUPD- tion of cold joints. Each step in the handling and transporting of concrete needs to be controlled to maintain uniformity within a batch and from batch to batch.

EB-001.15, and PCI MNL 116, and PCI MNL 117 provide general information on accelerated curing. Acceler- ated curing procedures require careful attention to obtain uniform and satisfactory results. Preventing moisture loss during the curing is essential. The compressive strength of accelerated-cured concrete is not as high at later ages as that of nominally identical concrete continuously cured under moist conditions at moderate temperatures. Also, the modulus of elasticity, Ec, of accelerated-cured specimens may vary from that of speci- mens moist-cured at normal temperatures.

R26.6.4 Welding If welding of reinforcing bars is required, the weldability of the steel and compatible welding procedures need to be considered. The provisions in AWS D1.4 cover aspects of welding reinforcing bars, including criteria to qualify welding procedures. Weldability of the steel is based on its carbon equiva- lent (CE), calculated from the chemical composition of the steel. AWS D1.4 establishes preheat and interpass tempera- tures for a range of carbon equivalents and reinforcing bar sizes. AWS D1.4 has two expressions for calculating CE. The expression considering only the elements carbon and American Concrete Institute – Copyrighted © Material – www.concrete.org 538 ACI 318-19: BUILDING CODE REQUIREMENTS FOR STRUCTURAL CONCRETE CODE COMMENTARY ACI Collection Licensed to: Shannon Banchero 26.6.4.2 Compliance requirements: (a) Welding of all nonprestressed bars shall conform to the requirements of AWS D1.4 $670 VSHFL¿FDWLRQV IRU EDU manganese is to be used for bars other than ASTM A706. A more comprehensive CE expression is given for ASTM A706 bars, which is identical to the CE formula presented in ASTM A706. ASTM A706 covers low-alloy steel reinforcing bars intended for applications that require controlled tensile properties, welding, or both. Weldability is accomplished in ASTM A706 by requiring the CE not to exceed 0.55 percent and controlling the chemical composition. The manufacturer is required by ASTM A706 to report the chemical analysis and carbon equivalent (Gustafson and Felder 1991). When welding reinforcing bars other than ASTM A706, the FRQVWUXFWLRQ GRFXPHQWV VKRXOG VSHFL¿FDOO\ UHTXLUH WKDW WKH mill test report include chemical analysis results to permit calculation of the carbon equivalent. It is often necessary to weld to existing reinforcing bars in a structure when no mill test report of the existing reinforce- ment is available. This condition is particularly common in alterations or building expansions. AWS D1.4 states for such bars that a chemical analysis may be performed on repre- sentative bars. If the chemical composition is not known or obtained, AWS D1.4 requires a minimum preheat. For bars other than ASTM A706, the minimum preheat required is 300°F for No. 6 bars or smaller, and 500°F for No. 7 bars or larger. The required preheat for all sizes of ASTM A706 bars is to be the temperature given in the Welding Code’s table for minimum preheat corresponding to the range of CE “over 0.45 percent to 0.55 percent.” Welding of the partic- ular bars should be performed in accordance with AWS D1.4. It should also be determined if additional precautions are necessary, based on other considerations such as stress level in the bars, consequences of failure, and heat damage to existing concrete due to welding operations. AWS D1.4 requires the contractor to prepare welding SURFHGXUH VSHFL¿FDWLRQV :36V FRQIRUPLQJ WR WKH UHTXLUH- ments of the Welding Code. Appendix A in AWS D1.4 contains a suggested form that shows the information required for a WPS. Welding of wire to wire, and of wire or welded wire rein- forcement to reinforcing bars or structural steel elements is not covered by AWS D1.4. If welding of this type is required on a project, the construction documents should specify requirements or performance criteria for this welding. If cold-drawn wires are to be welded, the welding proce- dures should address the potential loss of yield strength and ductility achieved by the cold-working process (during manufacture) when such wires are heated by welding. These potential concerns are not an issue for machine and resis- tance welding as used in the manufacture of welded plain and deformed wire reinforcement covered by ASTM A1064.

If further investi- gation is deemed necessary, such investigation may include in-place tests as described in ACI 228.1R or, in extreme cases, measuring the compressive strength of cores taken from the structure. In-place tests of concrete, such as probe penetration (ASTM C803), rebound hammer (ASTM C805), or pullout test (ASTM C900), may be useful in determining whether a portion of the structure actually contains low-strength concrete. Unless these in-place tests have been correlated with compressive strength using accepted procedures, such as described in ACI 228.1R, they are of value primarily for comparisons within the same structure rather than as quanti- tative estimates of strength.

This gradient lowers the apparent compressive strength of the core (Bartlett and MacGregor 1994). The requirement of at least 5 days between the time of last being wetted and time of testing provides time for the moisture gradient to be reduced. If a water-cooled saw is used for end trimming, the conditioning period begins when sawing is completed. The maximum time of 7 days between coring and testing is intended to ensure timely testing of cores if strength of concrete is in question. If end trimming with a water-cooled saw is necessary, it should be done within 2 days of drilling the core to meet the time limits established by the testing criterion. Research (Bartlett and MacGregor 1994) has also shown that other moisture conditioning procedures, such as soaking RU DLU GU\LQJ D൵HFW PHDVXUHG FRUH VWUHQJWKV DQG UHVXOW LQ conditions that are not representative of the in-place concrete.

R27.2—General R27.2.1 If a load test is described as part of the strength evaluation process, it is desirable for all parties to agree on the region to be loaded, the magnitude of the load, the load test procedure, and acceptance criteria before any load tests are conducted. If the safety concerns are related to an assem- blage of members or an entire structure, it is not feasible to load test every member and section.
