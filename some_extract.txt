 ACI 318-19: BUILDING CODE REQUIREMENTS FOR STRUCTURAL CONCRETE 3
 
 PREFACE TO ACI 318-19 
 The “Building Code Requirements for Structural Concrete” (“Code”) provides minimum requirements for the materials,
 design, and detailing of structural concrete buildings and, where applicable, nonbuilding structures. This Code was developed
 by an ANSI-approved consensus process and addresses structural systems, members, and connections, including cast-in-place,
 precast, shotcrete, plain, nonprestressed, prestressed, and composite construction. Among the subjects covered are: design and
 construction for strength, serviceability, and durability; load combinations, load factors, and strength reduction factors; struc-
 tural analysis methods; deÝection limits; mechanical and adhesive anchoring to concrete; development and splicing of rein-
 forcement; construction document information; Üeld inspection and testing; and methods to evaluate the strength of existing 
 structures. 
 The Code was substantially reorganized and reformatted in 2014, and this Code continues and expands that same organi-
 zational philosophy. The principal objectives of the reorganization were to present all design and detailing requirements for
 structural systems or for individual members in chapters devoted to those individual subjects, and to arrange the chapters in
 a manner that generally follows the process and chronology of design and construction. Information and procedures that are
 common to the design of multiple members are located in utility chapters. Additional enhancements implemented in this Code
 to provide greater clarity and ease of use include the Ürst use of color illustrations and the use of color to help the user navigate 
 the Code and quickly Ünd the information they need. Special thanks to Bentley Systems, Incorporated, for use of their ProCon-
 crete software to produce many of the Ügures found in the Commentary.
 Uses of the Code include adoption by reference in a general building code, and earlier editions have been widely used in
 this manner. The Code is written in a format that allows such reference without change to its language. Therefore, background
 details or suggestions for carrying out the requirements or intent of the Code provisions cannot be included within the Code
 itself. The Commentary is provided for this purpose. 
 Some considerations of the committee in developing the Code are discussed in the Commentary, with emphasis given to
 the explanation of new or revised provisions. Much of the research data referenced in preparing the Code is cited for the user
 desiring to study individual questions in greater detail. Other documents that provide suggestions for carrying out the require-
 ments of the Code are also cited. 
 Technical changes from ACI 318-14 to ACI 318-19 are outlined in the August 2019 issue of Concrete International and are
 marked in the text of this Code with change bars in the margins.

 excluded from the scope of Chapter 17 and ACI 355.4. To
 limit shrinkage and reduce displacement under load, most
 adhesive anchor systems require the annular gap to be as
 narrow as practical while still maintaining suඓcient clear-

 hole and ensuring complete coverage of the bonded area over
 the embedded length. The annular gap for reinforcing bars is
 generally greater than that for threaded rods. The required

 general building code. strength reduction factors ࣂ applied to the nominal strengths.
 The strength of a member or cross section, calculated
 using standard assumptions and strength equations, along
 with nominal values of material strengths and dimensions,
 is referred to as nominal strength and is generally designated
 S . Design strength or usable strength of a member or cross
 n 
 section is the nominal strength reduced by the applicable
 strength reduction factor ࣂ. The purpose of the strength
 reduction factor is to account for the probability of under-
 strength due to variations of in-place material strengths and
 dimensions, the eඒect of simplifying assumptions in the 
 design equations, the degree of ductility, potential failure
 mode of the member, the required reliability, and signiÜ-
 cance of failure and existence of alternative load paths for
 the member in the structure. 
 This Code, or the general building code, prescribes design
 load combinations, also known as factored load combina-
 tions, which deÜne the way diඒerent types of loads are 
 multiplied (factored) by individual load factors and then
 combined to obtain a factored load U. The individual load
 factors and additive combination reÝect the variability in 
 magnitude of the individual loads, the probability of simul-
 taneous occurrence of various loads, and the assumptions
 and approximations made in the structural analysis when
 determining required design strengths.
 A typical design approach, where linear analysis is appli-
 cable, is to analyze the structure for individual unfactored
 load cases, and then combine the individual unfactored load
 cases in a factored load combination to determine the design
 load eඒects. Where eඒects of loads are nonlinearÏfor 
 example, in foundation uplift—the factored loads are applied
 simultaneously to determine the nonlinear, factored load
 eඒect. The load eඒects relevant for strength design include 
 moments, shears, torsions, axial forces, bearing forces, and
 punching shear stresses. Sometimes, design displacements
 are determined for factored loads. The load eඒects relevant 
 for service design include stresses and deÝections.
 In the course of applying these principles, the licensed
 design professional should be aware that providing more
 strength than required does not necessarily lead to a safer
 structure because doing so may change the potential failure
 mode. For example, increasing longitudinal reinforcement
 area beyond that required for moment strength as derived
 from analysis without increasing transverse reinforcement
 could increase the probability of a shear failure occurring

 the induced stresses in the body of the member vary during
 fabrication, storage, transportation, erection, and the Ünal 
 interconnected conÜguration. Consequently, the member 
 design forces to be considered may diඒer in magnitude and 
 direction with varying critical sections at various stages of

 be simply supported for dead load eඒects before continuity 
 at the supporting connections is established and may be a

 due to the moment continuity created by the connections
 after erection.

 If the service loads speciÜed by the general building code 
 diඒer from those of ASCE/SEI 7, the general building code 
 governs. However, if the nature of the loads contained in a
 general building code diඒers considerably from ASCE/SEI 7 
 loads, some provisions of this Code may need modiÜcation 
 to reÝect the diඒerence.
 5.2.2 Loads and Seismic Design Categories (SDCs) shall R5.2.2 Seismic Design Categories (SDCs) in this Code

 mined by the building oඓcial. are used by the International Building Code (2018 IBC) and
 the National Fire Protection Association (NFPA 5000 2012).
 The BOCA National Building Code (BOCA 1999) and “The
 Standard Building Code” (SBC 1999) used seismic perfor-
 mance categories. The “Uniform Building Code” (IBCO
 1997) relates seismic design requirements to seismic zones,
 whereas editions of ACI 318 prior to 2008 related seismic
 design requirements to seismic risk levels. Table R5.2.2
 correlates SDC to seismic risk terminology used in ACI
 318 for several editions before the 2008 edition, and to the
 various methods of assigning design requirements used in
 the United States under the various model building codes,
 the ASCE/SEI 7 standard, and the National Earthquake 
 Hazard Reduction Program (NEHRP 1994).
 Design requirements for earthquake-resistant structures in
 this Code are determined by the SDC to which the structure
 is assigned. In general, the SDC relates to seismic hazard
 level, soil type, occupancy, and building use. Assignment of
 a building to an SDC is under the jurisdiction of the general
 building code rather than this Code. 
 In the absence of a general building code that prescribes
 earthquake eඒects and seismic zoning, it is the intent of 
 Committee 318 that application of provisions for earth-
 quake-resistant design be consistent with national standards
 or model building codes such as ASCE/SEI 7, 2012 IBC, 
 and NFPA 5000. The model building codes also specify
 overstrength factors ¼ that are related to the seismic-force-
 o 
 resisting system used for the structure and design of certain
 elements.

 they are more accurately determined and less variable, are
 assigned a lower load factor than live loads. Load factors
 also account for variability in the structural analysis used to
 calculate moments and shears. 
 The Code gives load factors for speciÜc combinations of 
 loads. In assigning factors to combinations of loading, some
 consideration is given to the probability of simultaneous
 occurrence. While most of the usual combinations of load-
 ings are included, it should not be assumed that all cases are
 covered. 
 Due regard is to be given to the sign (positive or nega-
 tive) in determining U for combinations of loadings, as one
 type of loading may produce eඒects of opposite sense to that 
 produced by another type. The load combinations with 0.9D
 are included for the case where a higher dead load reduces
 the eඒects of other loads. The loading case may also be crit-
 ical for tension-controlled column sections. In such a case,
 a reduction in compressive axial load or development of
 tension with or without an increase in moment may result in
 a critical load combination.

 PART 2: LOADS & ANALYSIS 63 
 
 
 CODE COMMENTARY 
 Consideration should be given to various combinations of
 loading to determine the most critical design condition. This
 is particularly true when strength is dependent on more than
 one load eඒect, such as strength for combined Ýexure and 
 axial load or shear strength in members with axial load.
 If unusual circumstances require greater reliance on the
 strength of particular members than circumstances encoun-
 tered in usual practice, some reduction in the stipulated
 strength reduction factors ࣂ or increase in the stipulated load
 factors may be appropriate for such members.
 Rain load R in Eq. (5.3.1b), (5.3.1c), and (5.3.1d) should
 account for all likely accumulations of water. Roofs should be
 designed with suඓcient slope or camber to ensure adequate 
 drainage accounting for any long-term deÝection of the roof 
 due to the dead loads. If deÝection of roof members may 
 result in ponding of water accompanied by increased deÝec-
 tion and additional ponding, the design should ensure that
 this process is self-limiting. 
 Model building codes and design load references refer
 to earthquake forces at the strength level, and the corre-
 sponding load factor is 1.0 (ASCE/SEI 7; BOCA 1999; SBC
 1999; UBC (ICBO 1997); 2018 IBC). In the absence of a
 general building code that prescribes strength level earth-
 quake eඒects, a higher load factor on E would be required.
 The load eඒect E in model building codes and design load
 reference standards includes the eඒect of both horizontal and 
 vertical ground motions (as E and E, respectively). The
 h v 
 eඒect for vertical ground motions is applied as an addition 
 to or subtraction from the dead load eඒect (D), and it applies
 to all structural elements, whether part of the seismic force-
 resisting system or not, unless speciÜcally excluded by the 
 general building code. 
 5.3.2 The eඒect of one or more loads not acting simultane-
 ously shall be investigated. 
 5.3.3 The load factor on live load L in Eq. (5.3.1c), R5.3.3 The load modiÜcation factor in this provision is

 to lateral deformations along individual members, as well as
 sidesway of the overall structure. If the second-order analysis
 uses nodes at the member intersections only, the analysis
 captures the sidesway eඒects for the overall structure but 
 neglects individual member slenderness eඒects. In this case, 
 the moment magniÜer method (6.6.4) is used to determine 
 individual member slenderness eඒects.

 CODE COMMENTARY 
 An inelastic analysis i) represents the nonlinear stress-
 strain response of the materials composing the structure;
 ii) satisÜes compatibility of deformations; and iii) satisÜes 
 equilibrium in the undeformed conÜguration for Ürst-order 
 analysis or in the deformed conÜguration for second-order 
 analysis. 
 Finite element analysis was introduced in the 2014 Code
 to explicitly recognize a widely used analysis method.

 TThhee provisions for redistribution of moments apply
 equally to prestressed members (Mast 1992).
 The elastic deformations caused by a nonconcordant tendon
 change the amount of inelastic rotation required to obtain a
 given amount of redistribution of moments. Conversely, for
 a beam with a given inelastic rotational capacity, the amount
 by which the moment at the support may be varied is changed
 by an amount equal to the secondary moment at the support
 due to prestressing. Thus, the Code requires that secondary
 moments caused by reactions generated by prestressing
 forces be included in determining design moments.
 Redistribution of moments as permitted by 6.6.5 is not
 appropriate where approximate values of bending moments
 are used, such as provided by the simpliÜed method of 6.5.
 Redistribution of moments is also not appropriate for
 two-way slab systems that are analyzed using the pattern
 loadings given in 6.4.3.3. These loadings use only 75
 percent of the full factored live load, which is based on
 considerations of moment redistribution.

 design should represent the stiඒnesses of the members

 Instead, they should correspond to the moment-end rotation

 (d) Two-way joist systems in accordance with 8.8 design rules, as well as historical precedents, limit the types
 of structures to which this chapter applies. General slab
 systems that may be designed according to this chapter
 include Ýat slabs, Ýat plates, two-way slabs, and waඔe 
 slabs. Slabs with paneled ceilings are two-way, wide-band,
 beam systems. 
 Slabs-on-ground that do not transmit vertical loads from
 other parts of the structure to the soil are excluded.
 For slabs with beams, the explicit design procedures of
 this chapter apply only when the beams are located at the
 edges of the panel and when the beams are supported by
 columns or other essentially nondeÝecting supports at the 
 corners of the panel. Two-way slabs with beams in one
 direction, with both slab and beams supported by girders
 in the other direction, may be designed under the general
 requirements of this chapter. Such designs should be based
 upon analysis compatible with the deÝected position of the 
 supporting beams and girders. 
 For slabs supported on walls, the explicit design proce-

 in all cases, evaluation of the stress conditions around the
 supports in relation to shear, torsion, and Ýexure, as well as 
 the eඒects of reduced stiඒness of elements due to cracking 
 and support geometry. The design of a slab system involves
 more than its analysis; any deviations in physical dimensions
 of the slab from common practice should be justiÜed on the 
 basis of knowledge of the expected loads and the reliability
 of the calculated stresses and deformations of the structure.

 If the factored shear for a slab-column connection is large,
 the slab-column joint cannot always develop all of the rein-
 forcement provided in the eඒective width. The modiÜcations 
 for interior slab-column connections in this provision are
 permitted only where the reinforcement required to develop

 ty ty 
 21.2.2. The use of Eq. (8.4.2.2.2) without the modiÜcation 
 permitted in this provision will generally indicate overstress
 conditions on the joint. This provision is intended to improve
 ductile behavior of the slab-column joint. If reversal of
 moments occurs at opposite faces of an interior column, both
 top and bottom reinforcement should be concentrated within
 the eඒective width. A ratio of top-to-bottom reinforcement of 
 approximately 2 has been observed to be appropriate.

 The fraction of M not transferred by eccentricity of the

 8.4.2.2. A conservative method assigns the fraction trans-
 ferred by Ýexure over an eඒective slab width deÜned in

 near the column to accommodate M . Available test data
 sc 
 (Hanson and Hanson 1968) seem to indicate that this prac-

 c 
 required. The tensile force N is calculated at service load on
 c 
 the basis of an uncracked, homogeneous section.
 Research on unbonded post-tensioned two-way Ýat slab 
 systems (Joint ACI-ASCE Committee 423 1958, 1974; ACI
 423.3R; Odello and Mehta 1967) shows that bonded rein-
 forcement in negative moment regions, proportioned on the
 basis of 0.075 percent of the cross-sectional area of the slab-
 beam strip, provides suඓcient ductility and reduces crack 
 width and spacing. The same area of bonded reinforcement
 is required in slabs with either bonded or unbonded tendons.
 The minimum bonded reinforcement area required by Eq.
 (8.6.2.3(c)) is a minimum area independent of grade of rein-
 forcement or design yield strength. To account for diඒerent 
 adjacent tributary spans, this equation is given on the basis
 of slab-beam strips as deÜned in 2.3. For rectangular slab
 panels, this equation is conservatively based on the greater
 of the cross-sectional areas of the two intersecting slab-
 beam strips at the column. This ensures that the minimum
 percentage of reinforcement recommended by research
 is provided in both directions. Concentration of this rein-
 forcement in the top of the slab directly over and immedi-
 ately adjacent to the column is important. Research also
 shows that where low tensile stresses occur at service loads,
 satisfactory behavior has been achieved at factored loads
 without bonded reinforcement. However, the Code requires
 minimum bonded reinforcement regardless of service load
 stress levels to help ensure Ýexural continuity and ductility, 
 and to limit crack widths and spacing due to overload,
 temperature, or shrinkage. Research on post-tensioned Ýat 
 plate-to-column connections is reported in Smith and Burns
 (1974), Burns and Hemakom (1977), Hawkins (1981), PTI
 TAB.1, and Foutch et al. (1990). 
 Unbonded post-tensioned members do not inherently
 provide large capacity for energy dissipation under severe
 earthquake loadings because the member response is
 primarily elastic. For this reason, unbonded post-tensioned
 structural members reinforced in accordance with the provi-
 sions of this section should be assumed to resist only vertical
 loads and to act as horizontal diaphragms between energy-
 dissipating elements under earthquake loadings of the
 magnitude deÜned in 18.2.1.

 8.8.1General R8.8.1General 
 The empirical limits established for nonprestressed rein-
 forced concrete joist Ýoors are based on successful past 
 performance of joist construction using standard joist
 forming systems. For prestressed joist construction, this
 section may be used as a guide. 
 8.8.1.1 Nonprestressed two-way joist construction consists 
 of a monolithic combination of regularly spaced ribs and a 
 top slab designed to span in two orthogonal directions. 
 8.8.1.2 Width of ribs shall be at least 4 in. at any location 
 along the depth.

 minimum width. 
 
 8.8.1.4 Clear spacing between ribs shall not exceed 30 in. R8.8.1.4 A limit on the maximum spacing of ribs is
 required because of the provisions permitting higher shear
 strengths and less concrete cover for the reinforcement for
 these relatively small, repetitive members.
 8.8.1.5 V shall be permitted to be taken as 1.1 times the R8.8.1.5 The increase in shear strength is justiÜed on the 
 c 
 values calculated in 22.5. basis of: 1) satisfactory performance of joist construction
 designed with higher calculated shear strength speciÜed in 
 previous Codes, which allowed comparable shear stresses;
 and 2) potential for redistribution of local overloads to adja-
 cent joists. 
 8.8.1.6 For structural integrity, at least one bottom bar 
 in each joist shall be continuous and shall be anchored to 
 develop f at the face of supports. 
 y 
 8.8.1.7 Reinforcement area perpendicular to the ribs shall 
 satisfy slab moment strength requirements, considering 
 load concentrations, and shall be at least the shrinkage and 
 temperature reinforcement area in accordance with 24.4.

 CODE COMMENTARY 
 Experience has shown that the overall integrity of a struc-
 ture can be substantially enhanced by minor changes in
 detailing of reinforcement and connections. It is the intent
 of this section of the Code to improve the redundancy and
 ductility in structures so that in the event of damage to a
 major supporting element or an abnormal loading event, the
 resulting damage may be localized and the structure will
 have a higher probability of maintaining overall stability.
 With damage to a support, top reinforcement that is
 continuous over the support, but not conÜned by stirrups, 
 will tend to tear out of the concrete and will not provide the
 catenary action required to bridge the damaged support. By
 making a portion of the bottom reinforcement continuous,
 catenary action can be provided. 
 If the depth of a continuous beam changes at a support,
 the bottom reinforcement in the deeper member should be
 terminated into the support with a standard hook or headed
 bar and the bottom reinforcement in the shallower member
 sshhoouulldd be extended into and fully developed in the deeper
 mmeemmbbeerr..

 Figure R9.7.7.1 shows an example of a two-piece stirrup
 that satisÜes the requirement of Sections 9.7.7.1(c) and 
 9.7.7.2(b). The 90-degree hook of the cap tie is located on
 the slab side so that it is better conÜned. Pairs of U-stirrups 
 lapping one another as deÜned in 25.7.1.7 are not permitted
 in perimeter or spandrel beams. In the event of damage to the
 side concrete cover, the top longitudinal reinforcement may
 tend to tear out of the concrete and will not be adequately
 restrained by the exposed lap splice of the stirrup. Thus, the
 top longitudinal reinforcement will not provide the catenary
 action needed to bridge over a damaged region. Further,
 lapped U-stirrups will not be eඒective at high torsional 
 moments as discussed in R9.7.6.3.1.

 and shrinkage of the concrete under sustained compressive
 stresses. Creep and shrinkage tend to transfer load from the
 concrete to the reinforcement, and the resultant increase in
 reinforcement stress becomes greater as the reinforcement

 reinforcement ratio to prevent reinforcement from yielding
 under sustained service loads (Richart 1933).

 In columns subject to moment and axial force, tensile
 stresses may occur on one face of the column for moderate
 and large eccentricities as shown in Fig. R10.7.5.2. If such
 stresses occur, 10.7.5.2.2 requires tension splices to be used.
 The splice requirements have been formulated on the basis
 that a compression lap splice has a tensile strength of at least
 0.25f. Therefore, even if columns bars are designed for

 wall” as being synonymous with “shear wall.” While the
 term Ðshear wallÑ is not deÜned in this Code, the deÜnition 
 of a structural wall in Chapter 2 states “a shear wall is a
 structural wall.” 
 ASCE/SEI 7 deÜnes a structural wall as a wall that meets 
 the deÜnition for a bearing wall or a shear wall. A bearing wall 
 is deÜned as a wall that supports vertical load beyond a certain 
 threshold value. A shear wall is deÜned as a wall, bearing or 
 nonbearing, designed to resist lateral forces acting in the plane
 of the wall. ASCE/SEI 7 deÜnitions are widely accepted.

 ƭ 
 Transverse reinforcement is not required in precast,
 prestressed walls equal to or less than 12 ft in width because
 this width is less than that in which shrinkage and tempera-
 ture stresses can build up to a magnitude requiring trans-
 verse reinforcement. In addition, much of the shrinkage
 occurs before the members are connected into the structure.
 Once in the Ünal structure, the members are usually not as 
 rigidly connected transversely as monolithic concrete; thus,
 the transverse restraint stresses due to both shrinkage and
 temperature change are signiÜcantly reduced.
 The minimum area of wall reinforcement for precast
 walls has been used for many years and is recommended by
 the Precast/Prestressed Concrete Institute (PCI MNL-120)
 and the Canadian Precast Concrete Design Standard (2016).
 Reduced minimum reinforcement and greater spacings in

 without cast-in-place concrete topping When subjected to lateral loads, such as the in-plane iner-
 tial loads acting on the roof diaphragm of Fig. R12.1.1, a
 diaphragm acts essentially as a beam spanning horizon-
 tally between vertical elements of the lateral-force-resisting
 system. The diaphragm thus develops in-plane bending
 moments, shears, and possibly other actions. Where vertical
 elements of the lateral-force-resisting system do not extend
 along the full depth of the diaphragm, collectors may be
 required to collect the diaphragm shear and transfer it to the
 vertical elements. The term “distributor” is sometimes used to
 describe a collector that transfers force from a vertical element
 of the lateral-force-resisting system into the diaphragm. This
 chapter describes minimum requirements for diaphragm and
 collector design and detailing, including conÜguration, anal-
 ysis models, materials, and strength. 
 This chapter covers only the types of diaphragms listed
 in this provision. Other diaphragm types, such as horizontal
 trusses, are used successfully in buildings, but this chapter
 does not include prescriptive provisions for those other types.

 which in turn distribute the lateral soil forces to other force-
 resisting elements. 
 (b) Diaphragm transfer forces—Vertical elements of the
 lateral-force-resisting system may have diඒerent properties 
 over their height, or their planes of resistance may change
 from one story to another, creating force transfers between
 vertical elements. A common location where planes of resis-
 tance change is at grade level of a building with an enlarged
 subterranean plan; at this location, forces may transfer
 from the narrower tower into the basement walls through a
 podium diaphragm (refer to Fig. R12.1.1).
 (c) Connection forces—Wind pressure acting on exposed
 building surfaces generates out-of-plane forces on those
 surfaces. Similarly, earthquake shaking can produce inertial
 forces in vertical framing and nonstructural elements such
 as cladding. These forces are transferred from the elements
 where the forces are developed to the diaphragm through
 connections. 
 (d) Column bracing forcesÏArchitectural conÜgura-
 tions sometimes require inclined columns, which can result
 in large horizontal thrusts acting within the plane of the
 diaphragms due to gravity and overturning actions. The
 thrusts can act in diඒerent directions depending on orien-
 tation of the column and whether it is in compression or
 tension. Where these thrusts are not balanced locally by
 other elements, the forces have to be transferred into the
 diaphragm so they can be transmitted to other suitable
 elements of the lateral-force-resisting system. Such forces
 are common and may be signiÜcant with eccentrically 
 loaded precast concrete columns that are not monolithic
 with adjacent framing. The diaphragm also provides lateral
 support to columns not designed as part of the lateral-force-
 resisting system by connecting them to other elements that
 provide lateral stability for the structure.
 (e) Diaphragm out-of-plane forces—Most diaphragms
 are part of Ýoor and roof framing and, therefore, support 
 gravity loads. The general building code may also require
 consideration of out-of-plane forces due to wind uplift pres-
 sure on a roof slab and vertical acceleration due to earth-
 quake eඒects.

 usually designed to remain elastic or nearly elastic for forces
 acting within their plane under factored load combinations.
 Therefore, analysis methods satisfying theory of elastic
 analysis are generally acceptable. The provisions for elastic
 analysis in 6.6.1 through 6.6.3 can be applied.
 Diaphragm in-plane stiඒness aඒects not only the distri-
 bution of forces within the diaphragm, but also the distri-
 bution of displacements and forces among the vertical
 elements. Thus, the diaphragm stiඒness model should be 
 consistent with characteristics of the building. Where the
 diaphragm is very stiඒ compared to the vertical elements, 
 as in a low aspect ratio, cast-in-place diaphragm supported
 by moment frames, it is acceptable to model the diaphragm
 as a completely rigid element. Where the diaphragm is Ýex-
 ible compared with the vertical elements, as in some jointed
 precast systems supported by structural walls, it may be
 acceptable to model the diaphragm as a Ýexible beam span-
 ning between rigid supports. In other cases, it may be advis-
 able to adopt a more detailed analytical model to account
 for the eඒects of diaphragm Ýexibility on the distribution 
 of displacements and forces. Examples include buildings

 in which diaphragm and vertical element stiඒnesses have 
 approximately the same value, buildings with large force
 transfers, and parking structures in which ramps connect
 between Ýoors and act essentially as bracing elements within 
 the building. 
 For diaphragms constructed of concrete slabs, ASCE/
 SEI 7 permits the assumption of a rigid diaphragm if the
 diaphragm aspect ratio falls within a prescribed limit, which
 is diඒerent for wind and earthquake loads, and if the structure 
 has no horizontal irregularities. ASCE/SEI 7 provisions do 
 not prohibit the rigid diaphragm assumption for other condi-
 tions, provided the rigid diaphragm assumption is reasonably
 consistent with anticipated behavior. Cast-in-place concrete
 diaphragms designed with the rigid-diaphragm assumption
 have a long history of satisfactory performance even though
 they may fall outside the ASCE/SEI 7 index values.
 12.4.2.3 Any set of reasonable and consistent assumptions R12.4.2.3 For low-aspect-ratio diaphragms that are entirely
 for diaphragm stiඒness shall be permitted. cast-in-place or comprise a cast-in-place topping slab on
 precast elements, the diaphragm is often modeled as a rigid
 element supported by Ýexible vertical elements. However, 
 eඒects of diaphragm Ýexibility should be considered where 
 such eඒects will materially aඒect calculated design actions. 
 Such eඒects should be considered for diaphragms that use 
 precast elements, with or without a cast-in-place topping.
 Where large transfer forces occur, as outlined in R12.2.1(b),
 more realistic design forces can be obtained by modeling
 diaphragm in-plane stiඒness. Diaphragms with long spans, 
 large cutout areas, or other irregularities may develop
 in-plane deformations that should be considered in design
 (refer to Fig. R12.4.2.3a). 
 For a diaphragm considered rigid in its own plane, and for
 semi-rigid diaphragms, the diaphragm internal force distri-
 bution can be obtained by modeling it as a horizontal rigid
 beam supported on springs representing lateral stiඒnesses 
 of the vertical elements (refer to Fig. R12.4.2.3b). Eඒects 
 of in-plane eccentricity between applied forces and vertical
 element resistances, resulting in overall building torsion,
 should be included in the analysis. Elements of the lateral-
 force-resisting system aligned in the orthogonal direction
 can participate in resisting diaphragm plan rotation (Moehle
 et al. 2010).

 Nominal strengths are prescribed in Chapter 22 for a

 in-plane moment, axial force, and shear; and in Chapter 23
 for a diaphragm or diaphragm segment idealized as a strut-

 force using provisions of 10.5.2 with the strength reduction
 factor for compression-controlled members in 21.2.2. For

 Diaphragms are designed under load combinations of 5.3.
 Where a diaphragm or part of a diaphragm is subjected to

 restriction on location of nonprestressed reinforcement and
 mechanical connectors is intended to control cracking and
 excessive joint opening that might occur near the edges if
 reinforcement or mechanical connectors were distributed
 throughout the diaphragm depth. The concentration of Ýex-
 ural tension reinforcement near the edge of the diaphragm
 also results in more uniform shear Ýow through the depth of 
 the diaphragm. 
 There are no restrictions on placement of prestressed rein-

 the prestressed reinforcement can resist, with the remainder
 of the moment resisted by reinforcement or mechanical

 The Code does not require that diaphragm boundary

 resists a large compressive force compared with axial
 strength, or is designed as a strut adjacent to an edge or
 opening, detailing with transverse reinforcement similar to
 column hoops should be considered.

 A collector is a region of a diaphragm that transfers forces
 between the diaphragm and a vertical element of the lateral-

 into the diaphragm to reduce nominal stresses and rein-
 forcement congestion, as shown in Fig. R12.5.3.7. Where a
 collector width extends into the slab, the collector width on
 each side of the vertical element should not exceed approxi-
 mately one-half the contact length between the collector and

 capable of transmitting all forces from the diaphragm to the
 collector and into the vertical elements (Moehle et al. 2010).

 Figure R13.2.6.5 illustrates the application of the shear
 force limits of 23.4.4 and the provisions of 13.2.7.2 for
 one-way shear design of a spread footing using the strut-and-

 or wall does not contribute to shear across the critical crack
 (Uzel et al. 2011), but the soil pressure within d contributes to
 the bending moment at the face of the column or wall.

 Calculation of shear requires that the soil reaction be
 obtained from factored loads, and the design strength be in
 accordance with Chapter 22. 
 Where necessary, shear around individual piles may be
 investigated in accordance with 8.5.3.1.2. If shear perim-
 eters overlap, the modiÜed critical perimeter b should be
 o 
 taken as that portion of the smallest envelope of individual
 shear perimeters that will actually resist the critical shear for
 the group under consideration. One such situation is illus-
 trated in Fig. R13.2.7.2.

 Section 16.2.4 gives requirements for integrity ties that
 apply to all precast concrete structures. The speciÜc require-

 These minimum provisions for ssttrruuccttuurraall iinntteeggrriittyy ties in
 large panel bearing wall structures are intended to provide
 an alternate load path in case of loss of a bearing wall

 length in this Code (22.5.3.1, 22.6.3.1, 22.7.2.1, 25.4.1.4).
 For some post-installed anchors, the capacity may be nega-
 tively aඒected by very high-strength concrete. These eඒects 
 are associated with diඓculty in fully expanding expansion 
 anchors, cutting grooves in the sidewall of the predrilled
 hole by the screw anchor’s threads, and reduced bond
 strength of adhesive anchors. The 8000 psi limit for post-
 installed anchors reÝects the current concrete strength range

 by the design procedures of 17.6.2 and 17.7.2. of the Code, there were limitations on the diameter and
 embedment of anchors to calculate the concrete breakout
 strength. These limitations were necessitated by the lack of
 test results on anchors with diameters larger than 2 in. and
 embedment lengths longer than 24 in. In 2011, limitations
 on anchor diameter and embedment length were revised to
 limit the diameter to 4 in. based on the results of tension
 and shear tests on large-diameter anchors with deep embed-
 ments (Lee et al. 2007, 2010). These tests included 4.25 in.
 diameter anchors, embedded 45 in., tested in tension and 3
 in. diameter anchors tested in shear. The 4 in. diameter limit
 was selected to maintain consistency with the largest diam-
 eter anchor permitted in ASTM F1554. Other ASTM speci-
 Ücations permit up to 8 in. diameter anchors; however, they 
 have not been tested to ensure applicability of the 17.6.2 and
 17.7.2 concrete breakout provisions.

 This deÜnition of screw anchor size is approximately the 
 diameter of the core or shank of the screw rather than the size
 of the larger external diameter of the thread. This deÜnition 
 diඒers from the diameter of standard anchors with ASME

 other post-installed mechanical anchors, is provided by the

 The Olsen et al. (2012) empirical design model was
 derived from a database of tests in cracked and uncracked
 concrete on metric-sized screw anchors tested in Europe
 and inch-sized anchors tested by independent laboratories in
 accordance with ICC-ES AC193. 
 For concrete screw anchors, the eඒective embedment 
 depth, h , is determined as a reduction from the nominal

 embedment based on geometric characteristics of the screw.
 The eඒective embedment is veriÜed during the qualiÜcation

 For practical reasons, anchor reinforcement is only used for
 cast-in anchor applications. 
 (a) Care needs to be taken in the selection and positioning
 of anchor reinforcement for tension. Ideally tension anchor
 reinforcement should consist of stirrups, ties, or hairpins
 placed as close as practicable to the anchor. It is beneÜcial 
 for the anchor reinforcement to enclose the surface rein-
 forcement where applicable. Anchor reinforcement spaced
 less than 0.5h from the anchor centerline may be consid-
 ef 
 ered as eඒective. The research (Eligehausen et al. 2006b)
 on which these provisions are based was limited to anchor
 reinforcement with maximum diameter equivalent to a No.
 5 bar. 
 (b) To ensure development of anchor reinforcement for
 shear, the enclosing anchor reinforcement shown in Fig.
 R17.5.2.1(b)(i) should be in contact with the anchor and
 placed as close as practicable to the concrete surface. The
 research (Eligehausen et al. 2006b) on which the provi-
 sions for enclosing reinforcement are based was limited to
 anchor reinforcement with maximum diameter equivalent to
 a No. 5 bar. The larger bend radii associated with larger bar
 diameters may signiÜcantly reduce the eඒectiveness of the 
 anchor reinforcement for shear; therefore, anchor reinforce-
 ment larger than a No. 6 bar is not recommended. Because
 development for full f is required, the use of excess rein-
 y 
 forcement to reduce development length is not permitted for
 anchor reinforcement. 
 The anchor reinforcement for shear may also consist
 of stirrups, ties, hoops, or hairpins enclosing the edge
 reinforcement embedded in the breakout volume and
 placed as close to the anchors as practicable (refer to Fig.
 R17.5.2.1b(ii)). Generally, reinforcement spaced less than
 the smaller of 0.5c and 0.3c from the anchor centerline
 a1 a2 
 should be included as anchor reinforcement. In this case, the
 anchor reinforcement must be developed on both sides of
 the breakout surface. For equilibrium, edge reinforcement is
 required. The research on which these provisions are based
 was limited to anchor reinforcement with maximum diam-
 eter equivalent to a No. 6 bar.

 method used (rotary impact drill, rock drill, or core drill), and
 anticipated in-service temperature variations in the concrete.

 The 0.55 factor used for the additional calculation for
 sustained tension is correlated with ACI 355.4 test require-
 ments and provides satisfactory performance of adhesive
 anchors under sustained tensile loads in accordance with
 ACI 355.4. Product evaluation according to ACI 355.4 is
 based on sustained tensile loads being present for 50 years
 at a standard temperature of 70°F and 10 years at a temper-
 ature of 110°F. For longer life spans (for example, greater
 than 50 years) or higher temperatures, lower factors should
 be considered. Additional information on use of adhesive
 anchors for such conditions can be found by consulting with
 the adhesive manufacturer. 
 Adhesive anchors are particularly sensitive to installation
 direction and load type. Adhesive anchors installed overhead
 that resist sustained tension are of concern because previous
 applications of this type have led to failures (National Trans-
 portation Safety Board 2007). Other anchor types may be
 more appropriate for such cases. For adhesive anchors that
 resist sustained tension in horizontal or upwardly inclined
 orientations, it is essential to meet test requirements of ACI
 355.4 for sensitivity to installation direction, use certiÜed 
 installers, and require special inspection. Inspection and
 installation requirements are provided in Chapter 26.
 17.5.2.2.1 For groups of adhesive anchors subject to R17.5.2.2.1 The check for anchor groups is limited to the
 sustained tension, Eq. (17.5.2.2) shall be satisÜed for the highest loaded anchor in the group, analogous to the design

 results in calculated strengths in substantial agreement with 
 results of comprehensive tests. This requirement shall be 
 considered satisÜed by 17.8.

 ings, and thicknesses in 17.9 to preclude splitting failure. 
 
 17.5.2.5 Anchors in structures assigned to Seismic Design 
 Category C, D, E, or F shall satisfy the additional require-

 For the example shown in Fig. R17.6.2.1.2, point “A” shows
 the intersection of the assumed failure surface for limiting

 thawing or elevated temperatures resulting from direct sun

 The characteristic bond stresses associated with speciÜc 
 adhesive anchor systems are dependent on a number of param-
 eters. Consequently, care should be taken to include all param-
 eters relevant to the value of characteristic bond stress used in
 the design. These parameters include but are not limited to:
 (a) Type and duration of loading—bond strength is
 reduced for sustained tension 
 (b) Concrete cracking—bond strength is higher in
 uncracked concrete 
 (c) Anchor size—bond strength is generally inversely
 proportional to anchor diameter 
 (d) Drilling method—bond strength may be lower for
 anchors installed in core-drilled holes
 (e) Degree of concrete saturation at time of hole drilling
 and anchor installation—bond strength may be reduced
 due to concrete saturation 
 (f) Concrete temperature at time of installation—installa-
 tion of anchors in cold conditions may result in retarded
 adhesive cure and reduced bond strength
 (g) Concrete age at time of installation—installation in
 early-age concrete may result in reduced bond strength
 (refer to R17.2.2) 
 (h) Peak concrete temperatures during anchor service

 thin concrete members exposed to direct sunlight), elevated
 concrete temperatures can result in reduced bond strength
 (i) Chemical exposure—anchors used in industrial envi-
 ronments may be exposed to increased levels of contami-
 nants that can reduce bond strength over time
 Anchors tested and assessed under ACI 355.4 may in some
 cases not be qualiÜed for all of the installation and service 
 environments represented in Table 17.6.5.2.5. Therefore,
 where the minimum values given in Table 17.6.5.2.5 are
 used for design, the relevant installation and service envi-
 ronments should be speciÜed in accordance with 26.7.1(i), 
 (j), (k), and (l), and only anchors that have been qualiÜed 
 under ACI 355.4 for the installation and service environ-
 ments corresponding to the characteristic bond stress taken
 from Table 17.6.5.2.5 should be speciÜed.

 of anchors in the group. both anchors. For Case 2, the steel shear strength is provided
 entirely by the anchor farthest from the edge; no contribu-
 tion of the anchor near the edge is considered. In addition,
 checking the near-edge anchor for concrete breakout under
 service loads is advisable to preclude undesirable cracking
 at service conditions. If the anchor spacing s is less than the
 edge distance to the near-edge anchor, the failure surfaces
 may merge (Eligehausen et al. 2006b) and Case 3 of Fig.
 R17.7.2.1b may be taken as a conservative approach.
 If the anchors are welded to a common plate (regardless
 of anchor spacing s), when the anchor nearest the front edge
 begins to form a breakout failure, shear is transferred to the
 stiඒer and stronger rear anchor. For this reason, only Case 2 
 need be considered, which is consistent with Section 6.5.5
 of the PCI Design Handbook (PCI MNL 120). For determi-
 nation of steel shear strength, it is conservative to consider
 only the anchor farthest from the edge. However, for anchors
 having a ratio of s/c less than 0.6, both the front and rear
 a1,1 
 anchors may be assumed to resist the shear (Anderson and
 Meinheit 2007). For ratios of s/c greater than 1, it is advis-
 a1,1 
 able to check concrete breakout of the near-edge anchor to
 preclude undesirable cracking at service conditions.
 Further discussion of design for multiple anchors is given
 in Primavera et al. (1997). 
 For anchors near a corner required to resist a shear force
 with components normal to each edge, a satisfactory solu-
 tion is to check the connection independently for each
 component of the shear force. Other specialized cases, such
 as the shear resistance of anchor groups where all anchors do
 not have the same edge distance, are treated in Eligehausen
 et al. (2006a). 
 The detailed provisions of 17.7.2.1(a) apply to the case
 of shear directed toward an edge. If the shear is directed
 away from the edge, the strength will usually be governed
 by 17.7.1 or 17.7.3. The case of shear parallel to an edge

 Category (SDC) C, D, E, or F shall satisfy the additional in structures assigned to Seismic Design Categories (SDC)
 requirements of this section. C, D, E, or F are required to satisfy the additional require-
 ments of 17.10.2 through 17.10.7, regardless of whether
 earthquake-induced forces are included in the controlling
 load combination for the anchor design. In addition, all
 post-installed anchors in structures assigned to SDC C, D,
 E, or F must meet the requirements of ACI 355.2 or ACI
 355.4 for prequaliÜcation of anchors to resist earthquake-
 induced forces. Ideally, for tension, anchor strength should
 be governed by yielding of the ductile steel element of the
 anchor. If the anchor cannot meet the speciÜed ductility 
 requirements of 17.10.5.3(a), then the attachment should
 be designed to yield if it is structural or light gauge steel,
 or designed to crush if it is wood. If ductility requirements
 of 17.10.5.3(a) are satisÜed, then any attachments to the 
 anchor should be designed not to yield. In designing attach-
 ments using yield mechanisms to provide adequate ductility,
 as permitted by 17.10.5.3(b) and 17.10.6.3(a), the ratio of
 speciÜed yield strength to expected strength for the material 
 of the attachment should be considered in determining the
 design force. The value used for the expected strength should
 consider both material overstrength and strain hardening
 eඒects. For example, the material in a connection element 
 could yield and, due to an increase in its strength with strain
 hardening, cause a secondary failure of a sub-element or
 place extra force or deformation demands on the anchors.

 For a structural steel attachment, if only the speciÜed yield 
 strength of the steel is known, the expected strength should
 be taken as approximately 1.5 times the speciÜed yield 
 strength. If the actual yield strength of the steel is known,
 the expected strength should be taken as approximately 1.25
 times the actual yield strength. 
 Under earthquake conditions, the direction of shear may
 not be predictable. The full shear should be assumed in any
 direction for a safe design.

 chapter are applicable. Plastic hinge zones are considered to
 extend a distance equal to twice the member depth from any
 column or beam face, and also include any other sections in
 walls, frames, and slabs where yielding of reinforcement is
 likely to occur as a result of lateral displacements.
 If anchors must be located in plastic hinge regions, they
 should be detailed so that the anchor forces are transferred
 directly to anchor reinforcement that is designed to transmit
 the anchor forces into the body of the member beyond the

 element based on its speciÜed yield strength (refer to 
 18.5.2.2). Similarly, steel design manuals require structural
 steel connections that are designated nonyielding and part of
 the seismic load path to have design strengths that exceed a
 multiple of the nominal strength. That multiple depends on
 a factor relating the likely actual to speciÜed yield strength 
 of the material and an additional factor exceeding unity to
 account for material strain hardening. For attachments of
 cold-formed steel or wood, similar principles should be used
 to determine the expected strength of the attachment in order
 to determine the required strength of the anchors.
 Additional guidance on the use of options (a) through (d)
 is provided in the 2009 edition of the NEHRP Recommended
 Seismic Provisions for New Buildings and Other Structures
 (FEMA P750). The design of anchors in accordance with
 option (a) should be used only if the anchor yield behavior
 is well deÜned and if the interaction of the yielding anchor 
 with other elements in the load path has been adequately
 addressed. For the design of anchors in accordance with
 option (b), the force associated with yield of a steel attach-
 ment, such as an angle, baseplate, or web tab, should be the
 expected strength rather than the speciÜed yield strength of 
 the steel. Option (c) may apply to cases, such as the design
 of sill bolts where crushing of the wood limits the force that
 can be transferred to the bolt, or where the provisions of the

 of this chapter are intended to resist earthquake motions the design earthquake forces deÜned in documents such as 
 through ductile inelastic response of selected members. ASCE/SEI 7, the 2018 IBC, the UBC (ICBO 1997), and
 the NEHRP (FEMA P749) provisions are considered less
 than those corresponding to linear response at the antici-
 pated earthquake intensity (FEMA P749; Blume et al. 1961;
 Clough 1960; Gulkan and Sozen 1974). 
 The design philosophy in Chapter 18 is for cast-in-place
 concrete structures to respond in the nonlinear range when
 subjected to design-level ground motions, with decreased
 stiඒness and increased energy dissipation but without crit-
 ical strength decay. Precast concrete structures designed in
 accordance with Chapter 18 are intended to emulate cast-
 in-place construction, except 18.5, 18.9.2.3, and 18.11.2.2,
 which permit precast construction with alternative yielding
 mechanisms. The combination of reduced stiඒness and 
 increased energy dissipation tends to reduce the response
 accelerations and lateral inertia forces relative to values that
 would occur were the structure to remain linearly elastic and
 lightly damped (Gulkan and Sozen 1974). Thus, the use of
 design forces representing earthquake eඒects such as those 
 in ASCE/SEI 7 requires that the seismic-force-resisting 
 system retain a substantial portion of its strength into the
 inelastic range under displacement reversals.
 The provisions of Chapter 18 relate detailing require-
 ments to type of structural framing and SDC. Seismic design
 categories are adopted directly from ASCE/SEI 7, and relate 
 to considerations of seismic hazard level, soil type, occu-
 pancy, and use. Before the 2008 Code, low, intermediate,
 and high seismic risk designations were used to delineate
 detailing requirements. For a qualitative comparison of
 seismic design categories and seismic risk designations,
 refer to Table R5.2.2. The assignment of a structure to a SDC
 is regulated by the general building code (refer to 4.4.6.1).

 energy dissipation capacity, and deformation capacity of a
 proposed frame system equals or exceeds that provided by a
 comparable monolithic concrete system. ACI ITG-5.1 provides
 similar information for precast wall systems.
 The toughness requirement in 18.2.1.7 refers to the
 requirement to maintain ssttrruuccttuurraall iinntteeggrriittyy of the entire
 seismic-force-resisting system at lateral displacements
 anticipated for the maximum considered earthquake motion.
 Depending on the energy-dissipation characteristics of the

 The main objective of Chapter 18 is the safety of the struc-

 tion to the inÝuence of nonstructural members on structural 
 response and to hazards from falling objects.
 Section 18.2.2.3 serves as an alert that the base of structure as
 deÜned in analysis may not necessarily correspond to the foun-
 dation or ground level. Details of columns and walls extending
 below the base of structure to the foundation are required to be
 consistent with those above the base of structure.
 In selecting member sizes for earthquake-resistant struc-
 tures, it is important to consider constructibility problems
 related to congestion of reinforcement. The design should
 be such that all reinforcement can be assembled and placed
 in the proper location and that concrete can be cast and
 consolidated properly. Using the upper limits of permitted
 reinforcement ratios may lead to construction problems.

 special seismic systems requirements of 20.2.2. with ACI 318-19, ASTM A706 Grades 80 and 100 reinforce-
 ment is permitted to resist moments, axial, and shear forces
 in special structural walls and all components of special
 structural walls, including coupling beams and wall piers.
 ASTM A706 Grade 80 reinforcement is also permitted in
 special moment frames. Results of tests and analytical studies
 presented in NIST (2014) and Sokoli and Ghannoum (2016)
 indicate that properly detailed beams and columns of special
 moment frames with ASTM A706 Grade 80 reinforcement
 exhibit strength and deformation capacities similar to those
 of members reinforced with Grade 60 reinforcement. The
 use of Grade 100 reinforcement is not allowed in special
 moment frames because there is insuඓcient data to demon-
 strate satisfactory seismic performance.
 To allow the use of ASTM A706 Grade 80 and 100 rein-
 forcement, the 2019 Code includes limits for spacing of
 transverse reinforcement to provide adequate longitudinal
 bar support to control longitudinal bar buckling. In special
 moment frames, the use of Grade 80 reinforcement requires
 increased joint depths to prevent excessive slip of beam bars
 passing through beam-column joints (18.8.2.3).
 The requirement for a tensile strength greater than the yield
 strength of the reinforcement (20.2.2.5, Table 20.2.1.3(b)) is
 based on the assumption that the capability of a structural
 member to develop inelastic rotation capacity is a func-
 tion of the length of the yield region along the axis of the
 member. In interpreting experimental results, the length of

 CODE COMMENTARY 
 the yield region has been related to the relative magnitudes
 of nominal and yield moments (ACI 352R). According to
 this interpretation, the greater the ratio of nominal to yield
 moment, the longer the yield region. Chapter 20 requires
 that the ratio of actual tensile strength to actual yield strength
 be at least 1.25 for ASTM A615 Grade 60. 
 The restrictions on the value of f apply to all types of

 transverse reinforcement, including spirals, circular hoops,
 rectilinear hoops, and crossties. Research results (Budek
 et al. 2002; Muguruma and Watanabe 1990; Sugano et
 al. 1990) indicate that higher yield strengths can be used
 eඒectively as conÜnement reinforcement as speciÜed in 
 18.7.5.4. The increases to 80,000 psi and 100,000 psi for
 shear design of some special seismic system members is
 based on research indicating the design shear strength can be
 developed (Wallace 1998; Aoyama 2001; Budek et al. 2002;
 Sokoli and Ghannoum 2016; Cheng et al. 2016; Huq et al.
 2018; Weber-Kamin et al. 2019). The 60,000 psi restriction
 on the value of f for deformed bar in 20.2.2.4 for calcu-
 yt 
 lating nominal shear strength is intended to limit the width
 of shear cracks at service-level loads. Service-level cracking
 is not a concern in members of the seismic-force-resisting
 system subjected to design-level earthquake forces.
 18.2.7 Mechanical splices in special moment frames and R18.2.7Mechanical splices in special moment frames and 
 special structural walls special structural walls 
 In a structure undergoing inelastic deformations during
 an earthquake, the tensile stresses in reinforcement may
 approach the tensile strength of the reinforcement. The
 requirements for Type 2 mechanical splices are intended to
 avoid a splice failure when the reinforcement is subjected to
 expected stress levels in yielding regions. Type 1 mechanical
 splices on any grade of reinforcement and Type 2 mechan-
 ical splices on Grade 80 and Grade 100 reinforcement may
 not be capable of resisting the stress levels expected in
 yielding regions. The locations of these mechanical splices
 are restricted because tensile stresses in reinforcement in
 yielding regions can exceed the strength requirements of
 18.2.7.1. The restriction on all Type 1 mechanical splices
 and on Type 2 mechanical splices on Grade 80 and Grade
 100 reinforcement applies to all reinforcement resisting
 earthquake eඒects, including transverse reinforcement.
 Recommended detailing practice would preclude the
 use of splices in regions of potential yielding in members
 resisting earthquake eඒects. If use of mechanical splices in 
 regions of potential yielding cannot be avoided, there should
 be documentation on the actual strength characteristics of the
 bars to be spliced, on the force-deformation characteristics
 of the spliced bar, and on the ability of the mechanical splice
 to be used to meet the speciÜed performance requirements.
 Although mechanical splices as deÜned by 18.2.7 need not 
 be staggered, staggering is encouraged and may be necessary
 for constructibility or provide enough space around the splice
 for installation or to meet the clear spacing requirements.

 This Code is written with the assumption that special
 moment frames comprise horizontal beams and vertical
 columns interconnected by beam-column joints. It is accept-
 able for beams and columns to be inclined provided the
 resulting system behaves as a frame—that is, lateral resis-
 tance is provided primarily by moment transfer between
 beams and columns rather than by strut or brace action. In
 special moment frames, it is acceptable to design beams to
 resist combined moment and axial force as occurs in beams
 that act both as moment frame members and as chords or
 collectors of a diaphragm. It is acceptable for beams of
 special moment frames to cantilever beyond columns, but
 such cantilevers are not part of the special moment frame
 that forms part of the seismic-force-resisting system. It is
 acceptable for beams of a special moment frame to connect
 into a wall boundary if the boundary is reinforced as a
 special moment frame column in accordance with 18.7.
 A concrete braced frame, in which lateral resistance is
 provided primarily by axial forces in beams and columns, is
 not a recognized seismic-force-resisting system.

 increased to 85 percent to correspond to the 1 percent limit
 on the strain in prestressed reinforcement. Testing over this

 strated that more shear reinforcement is required to ensure
 a Ýexural failure if the member is subjected to alternating 
 nonlinear displacements than if the member is loaded in only
 one direction: the necessary increase of shear reinforcement
 being higher in the case of no axial load. This observation
 is reÝected in the Code (refer to 18.6.5.2) by eliminating 
 the term representing the contribution of concrete to shear
 strength. The added conservatism on shear is deemed neces-
 sary in locations where potential Ýexural hinging may occur. 
 However, this stratagem, chosen for its relative simplicity,
 should not be interpreted to mean that no concrete is
 required to resist shear. On the contrary, it may be argued
 that the concrete core resists all the shear with the shear
 (transverse) reinforcement conÜning and strengthening the 
 concrete. The conÜned concrete core plays an important 
 role in the behavior of the beam and should not be reduced
 to a minimum just because the design expression does not
 explicitly recognize it.

 CODE COMMENTARY 
 Precast concrete frame systems composed of elements
 joined using strong connections are intended to experience
 Ýexural yielding outside the connections. Strong connec-
 tions include the length of the mechanical splice hardware
 as shown in Fig. R18.9.2.2. Capacity-design techniques are
 used in 18.9.2.2(c) to ensure the strong connection remains
 elastic following formation of plastic hinges. Additional
 column requirements are provided to avoid hinging and
 strength deterioration of column-to-column connections.
 Strain concentrations have been observed to cause brittle
 fracture of reinforcing bars at the face of mechanical splices
 in laboratory tests of precast beam-column connections
 (Palmieri et al. 1996). Locations of strong connections should
 be selected carefully or other measures should be taken, such
 as debonding of reinforcing bars in highly stressed regions,
 to avoid strain concentrations that can result in premature
 fracture of reinforcement.

 CODE COMMENTARY 
 Equation (18.10.6.2b) is based on the mean top-of-wall
 drift capacity at 20 percent loss of lateral strength proposed
 by Abdullah and Wallace (2019). The requirement that drift
 capacity exceed 1.5 times the drift demand results in a low
 probability of strength loss for the design earthquake. The
 expression for b in (ii) is derived from Eq. (18.10.6.2b),
 assuming values of V /(8A f′) and Ō /h of approxi-
 u cv c u wcs 
 mately 1.0 and 0.015, respectively. If b varies over c, an
 average or representative value of b should be used. For
 example, at the Ýanged end of a wall, b should be taken equal
 to the eඒective Ýange width deÜned in 18.10.5.2, unless c
 extends into the web, then a weighted average should be
 used for b. At the end of a wall without a Ýange, b should be
 taken equal to the wall thickness. If the drift capacity does
 not exceed the drift demand for a trial design, then changes
 to the design are required to increase wall drift capacity,
 reduces wall drift demand, or both, such that drift capacity
 exceeds drift demand for each wall in a given building.

 shall be obtained from the general building code using the design forces for Ýoor and roof diaphragms typically are 
 applicable provisions and load combinations. not calculated directly during the lateral-force analysis that
 provides story forces and story shears. Instead, diaphragm
 design forces at each level are calculated by a formula
 that ampliÜes the story forces recognizing dynamic eඒects 
 and includes minimum and maximum limits. These forces
 are used with the governing load combinations to design
 diaphragms for shear and moment. 
 For collector elements, the general building code in the
 United States speciÜes load combinations that amplify 
 earthquake forces by a factor Ω . The forces ampliÜed 
 o 
 by Ω are also used for the local diaphragm shear forces
 o 
 resulting from the transfer of collector forces, and for local
 diaphragm Ýexural moments resulting from any eccentricity 
 of collector forces. The speciÜc requirements for earth-
 quake design forces for diaphragms and collectors depend
 on which edition of the general building code is used. The
 requirements may also vary according to the SDC.
 For most concrete buildings subjected to inelastic earth-
 quake demands, it is desirable to limit inelastic behavior of
 Ýoor and roof diaphragms under the imposed earthquake 
 forces and deformations. It is preferable for inelastic behavior
 to occur only in the intended locations of the vertical seismic-
 force-resisting system that are detailed for ductile response,
 such as in beam plastic hinges of special moment frames, or
 in Ýexural plastic hinges at the base of structural walls or in 
 coupling beams. For buildings without long diaphragm spans
 between lateral-force-resisting elements, elastic diaphragm
 behavior is typically not diඓcult to achieve. For buildings 
 where diaphragms could reach their Ýexural or shear strength 
 before yielding occurs in the vertical seismic-force-resisting
 system, the licensed design professional should consider
 providing increased diaphragm strength.
 For reinforced concrete diaphragms, ASCE/SEI 7 Sections
 12.10.1 and 12.10.2 provide requirements to determine
 design forces for reinforced concrete diaphragms. For precast
 concrete diaphragms in buildings assigned to SDC C, D, E, or

 CODE COMMENTARY 
 Earlier design practice assumed design moments for
 diaphragms were resisted entirely by chord forces acting
 at opposite edges of the diaphragm. This idealization was
 implicit in earlier versions of the Code, but has been replaced
 by an approach in which all longitudinal reinforcement,
 within the limits of 18.12.7, is assumed to contribute to the
 Ýexural strength of the diaphragm. This change reduces the 
 required area of longitudinal reinforcement concentrated
 near the edge of the diaphragm, but should not be interpreted
 as a requirement to eliminate all boundary reinforcement.

 For any portion of a member to be resistant to freezing

 strength is obtained by requiring a low w/cm, which also

 penetration. Entrained air makes it more diඓcult for the

 concrete to become saturated and allows for expansion of
 the water when it freezes. 
 Exposure class varies with degree of exposure to water,
 as this will inÝuence the likelihood that any portion of the 
 concrete will be saturated when exposed to cyclic freezing
 and thawing. Conditions that increase the potential for satu-
 ration include longer-duration or more-frequent contact
 with water without intervening drainage or drying periods.
 The likelihood that concrete in a member will be saturated
 depends on project location, member location and orienta-
 tion in the structure, and climate. Records of performance of
 similar members in existing structures in the same general
 location can also provide guidance in assigning exposure
 classes. 
 Exposure Category F is subdivided into four exposure
 classes: 
 (a) Exposure Class F0 is assigned to concrete that will not
 be exposed to cycles of freezing and thawing.
 (b) Exposure Class F1 is assigned to concrete that will be
 exposed to cycles of freezing and thawing and that will
 have limited exposure to water. Limited exposure to water
 implies some contact with water and water absorption;
 however, it is not anticipated that the concrete will absorb
 suඓcient water to become saturated. The licensed design 
 professional should review the exposure conditions care-
 fully to support the decision that the concrete is not antici-
 pated to become saturated before freezing. Even though
 concrete in this exposure class is not expected to become
 saturated, a minimum entrained air content of 3.5 to 6
 percent is required to reduce the potential for damage in
 case portions of the concrete member become saturated.
 (c) Exposure Class F2 is assigned to concrete that will
 be exposed to cycles of freezing and thawing and that
 will have frequent exposure to water. Frequent exposure
 to water implies that some portions of the concrete will
 absorb suඓcient water such that over time they will have 
 the potential to be saturated before freezing. If there is
 doubt about whether to assign Exposure Classes F1 or F2
 to a member, the more conservative choice, F2, should
 be selected. Exposure Classes F1 and F2 are conditions
 where exposure to deicing chemicals is not anticipated.
 (d) Exposure Class F3 is assigned to concrete that will be
 exposed to cycles of freezing and thawing with the same
 degree of exposure to water as Exposure Class F2. Addi-
 tionally, concrete in Exposure Class F3 is anticipated to
 be exposed to deicing chemicals. Deicing chemicals can
 increase water absorption and retention (Spragg et al.
 2011), which would enable the concrete to become satu-
 rated more readily. 
 Table R19.3.1 provides examples of concrete members for
 each of these exposure classes.

 Exposure Category S is subdivided into four exposure
 classes: 
 (a) Exposure Class S0 is assigned for conditions where
 the water-soluble sulfate concentration in contact with
 concrete is low and injurious sulfate attack is not a concern.
 (b) Exposure Classes S1, S2, and S3 are assigned for
 structural concrete members in direct contact with soluble
 sulfates in soil or water. The severity of exposure increases
 from Exposure Class S1 to S3 based on the more critical
 value of measured water-soluble sulfate concentration
 in soil or the concentration of dissolved sulfate in water.
 Seawater exposure is classiÜed as Exposure Class S1.
 Exposure Category W is subdivided into three exposure
 classes: 
 (a) Members are assigned to Exposure Class W0 if they
 are dry in service. 
 (b) Members are assigned to Exposure Class W1 if they
 may be exposed to continuous contact with water, to
 intermittent sources of water, or can absorb water from
 surrounding soil. Members assigned to W1 do not require
 concrete with low permeability. 
 (c) Members are assigned to Exposure Class W2 if they
 may be exposed to continuous contact with water, to
 intermittent sources of water, or can absorb water from
 surrounding soil, and if the penetration of water through
 the concrete might reduce durability or serviceability.
 Members assigned to W2 require concrete with low
 permeability.

 (a) Exposure Class C0 is assigned if exposure conditions
 do not require additional protection against the initiation
 of reinforcement corrosion. 
 (b) Exposure Classes C1 and C2 are assigned to nonpre-

 the degree of exposure to external sources of moisture and
 chlorides in service. Examples of exposures to external
 sources of chlorides include concrete in direct contact

 seawater, or spray from these sources.
 
 19.3.2Requirements for concrete mixtures R19.3.2Requirements for concrete mixtures
 19.3.2.1 Based on the exposure classes assigned from Durability of concrete is impacted by the resistance of
 Table 19.3.1.1, concrete mixtures shall conform to the most the concrete to Ýuid penetration. This is primarily aඒected 
 restrictive requirements in Table 19.3.2.1. by the w/cm and the composition of cementitious materials
 used in concrete. For a given w/cm, the use of Ýy ash, slag 
 cement, silica fume, or a combination of these materials
 will typically increase the resistance of concrete to Ýuid 
 penetration and thus improve concrete durability. The Code
 provides limits on w/cm in Table 19.3.2.1 to achieve low
 permeability and the intended durability. ASTM C1202 can
 be used to provide an indication of concrete’s resistance to
 Ýuid penetration.
 Because w/cm of concrete cannot be accurately veriÜed 
 in the Üeld using standard test methods, strength tests are 
 used as a surrogate. Representative values for minimum fƪ
 c 
 have been assigned to each w/cm limit in Table 19.3.2.1.
 The acceptance criteria for strength tests in 26.12 establish
 a basis to indicate that the maximum w/cm has not been
 exceeded. For this approach to be reliable, the values of fƪ 
 c 
 speciÜed in construction documents should be consistent with 
 the maximum w/cm.Considering the wide range of materials
 and concrete mixtures possible, including regional varia-
 tions, the minimum fƪ limit in Table 19.3.2.1 associated with
 c 
 the maximum w/cm should not be considered absolute. The
 average strength of concrete mixtures for a given w/cm can in
 some cases be considerably higher than the average strength
 expected for the representative value of fƪ. For a given expo-
 c 
 sure class, the licensed design professional may choose to
 specify a higher value of fƪ than listed in the table to obtain
 c 
 better consistency between the maximum w/cm and fƪ. This
 c 
 improves the conÜdence that concrete complies with the w/cm
 limit if the strength acceptance criteria are satisÜed.
 As stated in the footnote to Table 19.3.2.1, maximum w/cm
 limits are not speciÜed for lightweight concrete because the 
 amount of mixing water that is absorbed by the lightweight
 aggregates makes calculation of w/cm uncertain. There-
 fore, only a minimum fƪ is speciÜed to achieve the required 
 c 
 durability. 
 Table 19.3.2.1 provides the requirements for concrete on
 the basis of the assigned exposure classes. The most restric-
 tive requirements are applicable. For example, a member
 assigned to Exposure Class W1 and Exposure Class S2
 would require concrete to comply with a maximum w/cm of

 0.45 and a minimum fƪ of 4500 psi because the requirement
 c 
 for Exposure Class S2 is more restrictive than the require-
 ment for Exposure Class W1. 
 Exposure Classes F1, F2, and F3: In addition to
 complying with a maximum w/cm limit and a minimum
 fƪ, concrete for members subject to freezing-and-thawing
 c 
 exposures is required to be air entrained in accordance with
 19.3.3.1. Members assigned to Exposure Class F3 are addi-
 tionally required to comply with the limitations on the quan-
 tity of pozzolans and slag cement in the composition of the
 cementitious materials as given in 26.4.2.2(b).
 The requirements for plain concrete members in Exposure
 Class F3 are less restrictive because of the reduced likeli-
 hood of problems caused by reinforcement corrosion. The
 licensed design professional should consider the details of
 the minimal reinforcement to be included in plain concrete
 members to ensure that the less restrictive requirements are
 appropriate for the speciÜc project.
 Exposure Classes S1, S2, and S3: Table 19.3.2.1 lists
 the appropriate types of cement and the maximum w/cm
 and minimum fƪ for various sulfate exposure conditions. In
 c 
 selecting cement for sulfate resistance, the principal consid-
 eration is its tricalcium aluminate (C A) content.
 3 
 The use of Ýy ash (ASTM C618, Class F), natural pozzo-
 lans (ASTM C618, Class N), silica fume (ASTM C1240),
 or slag cement (ASTM C989) has been shown to improve
 the sulfate resistance of concrete (Li and Roy 1986; ACI
 233R; ACI 234R). Therefore, Footnote [7] to Table 19.3.2.1
 provides a performance option to determine the appropriate
 amounts of these materials to use in combination with the
 speciÜc cement types listed. ASTM C1012 is permitted to
 be used to evaluate the sulfate resistance of mixtures using
 combinations of cementitious materials in accordance with
 26.4.2.2(c). 
 Some ASTM C595 and ASTM C1157 blended cements
 can meet the testing requirements of 26.4.2.2.(c) without
 addition of pozzolans or slag cement to the blended cement
 as manufactured. 
 Note that sulfate-resisting cement will not increase resis-
 tance of concrete to some chemically aggressive solutions—
 for example, sulfuric acid. The construction documents
 should explicitly cover such cases. 
 In addition to the proper selection of cementitious mate-
 rials, other requirements for durable concrete exposed to
 water-soluble sulfates are essential, such as w/cm, strength,
 consolidation, uniformity, cover of reinforcement, and moist
 curing to develop the potential properties of the concrete.
 Exposure Class S1:ASTM C150 Type II cement is limited
 to a maximum C A content of 8 percent and is acceptable for
 3 
 use in Exposure Class S1. Blended cements under ASTM
 C595 with the MS designation, which indicates the cement
 meets requirements for moderate sulfate resistance, are also
 appropriate for use. Under ASTM C1157, the appropriate
 designation for moderate sulfate exposure is Type MS.

 PART 6: MATERIALS & DURABILITY 363 
 
 
 CODE COMMENTARY 
 Seawater is listed under Exposure Class S1 (moderate
 exposure) in Table 19.3.1.1, even though it generally contains
 more than 1500 ppm SO 2Î. Less expansion is produced by a
 4 
 given cement in seawater compared with freshwater with the
 same sulfate content (ACI 201.2R). Therefore, seawater is
 included in the same exposure class as solutions with lower
 sulfate concentrations. Portland cement with C A up to 10
 3 
 percent is allowed in concrete mixtures exposed to seawater
 if the maximum w/cm is limited to 0.40 (refer to the footnote
 to Table 19.3.2.1). 
 Exposure Class S2: ASTM C150 Type V cement is
 limited to a maximum C A content of 5 percent and is accept-
 3 
 able for use in Exposure Class S2. The appropriate binary
 and ternary blended cements under ASTM C595 include the
 suඓx (HS) as part of their designation, which indicates the 
 cement conforms to requirements for high sulfate resistance.
 Under ASTM C1157, the appropriate designation for severe
 sulfate exposure is Type HS. 
 Exposure Class S3 (Option 1): The beneÜt of the addi-
 tion of pozzolan or slag cement allows for a greater w/cm
 than required for Option 2. The amounts of supplementary
 cementitious materials are based on records of successful
 service or testing in accordance with 26.4.2.2(c).
 Exposure Class S3 (Option 2): This option allows the use
 of ASTM C150 Type V portland cement meeting the optional
 limit of 0.040 percent maximum expansion, ASTM C595
 binary and ternary blended cements with the (HS) suඓx 
 in their designation, and ASTM C1157 Type HS cements
 without the use of additional pozzolan or slag cement, but it
 instead requires a lower w/cm than that required for Option
 1. This lower w/cm reduces the permeability of the concrete
 and thus increases sulfate resistance(Lenz 1992). Use of this
 lower w/cm permits a shorter testing period to qualify the
 sulfate resistance of a cementitious system in accordance
 with 26.4.2.2(c). 
 In addition to the proper selection of cementitious mate-
 rials, other requirements for durable concrete exposed to
 water-soluble sulfates are essential, such as low w/cm,
 strength, adequate consolidation, uniformity, adequate cover
 of reinforcement, and suඓcient moist curing to develop the 
 potential properties of the concrete. 
 Exposure Class W1: This exposure class does not have
 speciÜc requirements for low permeability. However, 
 because of the exposure to water, the Code (26.4.2.2(d)) has a
 requirement to demonstrate that aggregates used in concrete
 are not alkali reactive according to ASTM C1778. If the
 aggregates are alkali-silica reactive, the Code (26.4.2.2(d))
 also requires submission of proposed mitigation measures.
 The Code (26.4.2.2(d)) prohibits the use of aggregates that
 are alkali-carbonate reactive. 
 Exposure Class W2: This exposure class requires low
 concrete permeability. The primary means to obtain a
 concrete with low permeability is to reduce w/cm. For a
 given w/cm, permeability can be reduced by optimizing
 the cementitious materials used in the concrete mixture.

 In addition, because of the exposure to water, the Code
 (26.4.2.2(d)) has a requirement to demonstrate that aggre-
 gates used in concrete are not alkali reactive according to
 ASTM C1778. If the aggregates are alkali-silica reactive,
 the Code (26.4.2.2(d)) also requires submission of proposed
 mitigation measures. The Code (26.4.2.2(d)) prohibits the
 use of aggregates that are alkali-carbonate reactive.
 Exposure Class C2: For nonprestressed and prestressed
 concrete in Exposure Class C2, the maximum w/cm,
 minimum speciÜed compressive strength, and minimum 
 cover are the basic requirements to be considered. Condi-
 tions should be evaluated for structures exposed to chlo-
 rides, such as in parking structures where chlorides may
 be tracked in by vehicles, or in structures near seawater.
 Coated reinforcement, corrosion-resistant steel reinforce-
 ment, and cover greater than the minimum required in 20.5
 can provide additional protection under such conditions.
 Use of slag cement meeting ASTM C989 or Ýy ash meeting 
 ASTM C618 and increased levels of speciÜed compressive 
 strength provide increased protection. Use of silica fume
 meeting ASTM C1240 with an appropriate high-range water
 reducer, ASTM C494, Types F and G, or ASTM C1017 can
 also provide additional protection (Ozyildirim and Halstead
 1988). The use of ASTM C1202 to test concrete mixtures
 proposed for use will provide additional information on the
 performance of the mixtures. 
 Chloride limits for Exposure Category C: For Exposure
 Classes C0, C1, and C2, the chloride ion limits apply to the
 chlorides contributed from the concrete materials, not from
 the environment surrounding the concrete. Even for Expo-
 sure Class C0, water-soluble chlorides introduced from the
 concrete materials can potentially induce corrosion of the
 reinforcement and must be limited for both nonprestressed
 and prestressed concrete, regardless of external expo-
 sure. For nonprestressed concrete, the permitted maximum
 amount of water-soluble chloride ions incorporated into
 the concrete, depends on the degree of exposure to an
 anticipated external source of moisture and chlorides. For
 prestressed concrete, the same limit of 0.06 percent chloride
 ion by mass of cementitious material applies regardless of
 exposure. The limits on chloride ion content for prestressed
 concrete are reduced from those for nonprestressed concrete
 because corrosion of prestressed reinforcement generally
 has more severe consequences than corrosion of nonpre-
 stressed reinforcement. Corrosion-induced reduction in the
 cross-sectional area of the prestressed reinforcement may
 result in fracture of the steel (ACI 222R). The presence of
 chloride ions may cause corrosion of embedded aluminum
 such as conduits, especially if the aluminum is in contact
 with embedded steel and the concrete is in a humid environ-
 ment. Requirements for protecting aluminum embedments
 from corrosion are given in 20.6.3 and 26.8.2.
 Allowable chloride limits are based on the mass of total
 cementitious materials rather than portland cement alone.
 This change was made in ACI 318-19 to reÝect Ündings that

 demonstrate the beneÜcial eඒects of supplementary cementi-
 tious materials (SCMs) in reducing permeability and binding
 chlorides, thus helping to inhibit corrosion (Kosmatka and
 Wilson 2016). Because there are diminishing eඒects with 
 increasing amounts of SCMs, the Code limits the mass of
 SCMs to 50 percent of the total cementitious materials that
 can be used to calculate the allowable amount of chloride
 ions in concrete (Tepke et al. 2016). 
 Additional information on the eඒects of chlorides on the 
 corrosion of steel reinforcement is given in ACI 201.2R,
 which provides guidance on concrete durability, and ACI
 222R, which provides guidance on factors that impact corro-
 sion of metals in concrete. Requirements for the evaluation
 of chloride ion content are provided in 26.4.2.2.

 including the sampling frequency, sampling protocol, test
 methods to be used, and the criteria for acceptance.
 The air content required for dry-mix shotcrete is for
 sampling of in-place shotcrete. This air content can be veri-
 Üed by taking cores from shotcrete test panels for analysis 
 in accordance with ASTM C457. During the mixture devel-
 opment process, shotcrete test panels may be prepared with
 diඒerent amounts of air-entraining admixture and cored to 
 determine a dosage that will provide the required amount of
 air after placement. 
 The use of ASTM C457 for quality control during
 construction is not practical. Although there are no standard
 tests for air content of dry-mix shotcrete during construc-
 tion, there are industry accepted methods for testing. These
 methods involve obtaining samples of dry-mix shotcrete and
 performing standard tests such as ASTM C231 to determine
 air content. 
 Field measurements of air content of dry-mix shotcrete
 have been obtained by shooting the material directly into a
 bowl of an air meter (Betrand and Vezina 1994). Samples for
 air content testing can also be taken from material shot into
 test panels, into a wheelbarrow, or onto the ground. These
 samples can then be used for testing in accordance with
 ASTM C231 (Zhang 2015).

 Grade 100 reinforcement is now permitted to resist tension
 and compression in some applications. For reinforcement
 resisting compression, strain compatibility calculations indi-
 cate that stresses are not likely to exceed 80,000 psi before
 strain in unconÜned concrete reaches the strain limit of 
 0.003 unless special conÜnement reinforcement is provided 
 to increase the limiting concrete compressive strain. For
 beams, the deÝection provisions of 24.2 and the limitations
 on distribution of Ýexural reinforcement of 24.3 become
 increasingly critical as f increases. 
 y 
 In Table 20.2.2.4(a), for deformed reinforcement in special
 moment frames and special structural walls, the use of longi-
 tudinal reinforcement with strength substantially higher than
 that assumed in design will lead to higher shear and bond
 stresses at the time of development of yield moments. These
 conditions may lead to brittle failures in shear or bond and
 should be avoided even if such failures may occur at higher
 loads than those anticipated in design. Therefore, ASTM
 A706 speciÜes both a lower and an upper limit on the actual 
 yield strength of the steel and requires a minimum tensile-to-
 yield strength ratio. ASTM A615 Grade 60 reinforcement in
 special seismic systems is permitted only if the requirements
 of 20.2.2.5(b) are satisÜed. ASTM A706 Grade 80 and Grade 
 100 are now permitted to resist tension and compression in
 some applications. ASTM A706 Grade 80 and Grade 100 are
 now permitted to resist moments, axial forces, and shear forces
 in special structural walls and all components of structural
 walls, including coupling beams and wall piers. ASTM A706
 Grade 80 is also permitted in special moment frames. For rein-
 forcement resisting compression, strain compatibility calcula-
 tions indicate that stresses are not likely to exceed 80,000 psi
 before strain in unconÜned concrete reaches the strain limit of

 0.003 unless special conÜnement reinforcement is provided to 
 increase the limiting concrete compressive strain.
 The maximum value of yield strength for calculation
 purposes is limited to 100,000 psi for both nonprestressed
 deformed reinforcement and plain spiral reinforcement in
 Tables 20.2.2.4(a) and (b), respectively, when used for lateral
 support of longitudinal bars or for concrete conÜnement. 
 The research that supports this limit for conÜnement is given 
 in Saatcioglu and Razvi (2002), Pessiki et al. (2001), and
 Richart et al. (1929). For reinforcement in special moment
 frames and special structural walls, the research that indi-
 cated that higher yield strengths can be used eඒectively for 
 conÜnement reinforcement is given in Budek et al. (2002),
 Muguruma and Watanabe (1990), and Sugano et al. (1990).
 The limit of 60,000 psi on the values of f and f used in
 y yt 
 design for most shear and torsional reinforcement is intended
 to control the width of inclined cracks under service-level
 gravity loads. The higher yield strength of 80,000 psi permitted
 in shear design for welded deformed wire reinforcement is
 also intended to control width of inclined cracks and is based
 on Guimares et al. (1992), Griezic et al. (1994), and Furlong
 et al. (1991). In particular, full-scale beam tests described in
 Griezic et al. (1994) indicated that the widths of inclined shear
 cracks at service load levels were less for beams reinforced
 with smaller diameter welded deformed wire reinforcement
 cages designed on the basis of a yield strength of 75,000 psi
 than beams reinforced with deformed Grade 60 stirrups.
 For strength-level earthquake load eඒects, tests of members 
 using higher strength reinforcement have shown acceptable
 behavior (Wallace 1998; Aoyama 2001; Budek et al. 2002;
 Sokoli and Ghannoum 2016; Cheng et al. 2016; Huq et al.
 2018; Weber-Kamin et al. 2019), leading to the allowance
 of ASTM A706 Grade 80 reinforcement for special seismic
 systems and ASTM A706 Grade 100 for special structural
 walls in the 2019 Code, as indicated in Table 20.2.2.4(a).
 Footnote [6] of Table 20.2.2.4(a) is provided because
 ASTM A1064 and A1022 only require the welds to develop
 35,000 psi in the interconnected wires. Hoops, stirrups, and
 other elements used in special seismic systems should have
 anchorages that are capable of developing 1.25f or 1.25f ,
 y yt 
 as applicable, or tensile strength of the bar or wire, whichever
 is less, so that moderate ductility capacity can be achieved.
 A welded product that is capable of developing these stress
 limits could be approved for use through Code Section 1.10.
 Footnote [3] of Table 20.2.2.4(a) limiting slab and beam
 bars passing through or extending from special structural
 walls to reinforcement meeting 20.2.2.5 provides for greater
 ductility of these members that are not designated as part of
 the seismic-force-resisting system but are likely to undergo
 large nonlinear rotational demands. 
 The 80,000 psi limit on f for ties of members or regions of
 y 
 members designed using the strut-and-tie method is imposed
 because of scarcity of test data justifying a higher limit. The
 yield strength f of “other” ties is limited to 60,000 psi for
 y 
 consistency with the usage “shear.”

 used for the particular types of prestressing reinforcement
 and particular types of ducts should be obtained from the
 manufacturers of the tendons. An unrealistically low estimate
 of the friction loss can lead to improper camber, or potential
 deÝection, of the member and inadequate prestress. Overes-
 timation of the friction may result in extra prestressing force.
 This could lead to excessive camber and excessive short-
 ening of a member. If the friction factors are determined to
 be less than those assumed in the design, the tendon stressing
 should be adjusted to provide only that prestressing force in
 the critical portions of the structure required by the design.

 CODE COMMENTARY 
 The condition “exposed to weather or in contact with
 ground” refers to direct exposure to moisture changes and
 not just to temperature changes. Slab soඓts are not usually 
 considered directly exposed unless subject to alternate
 wetting and drying, including that due to condensation
 conditions or direct leakage from exposed top surface, run
 oඒ, or similar eඒects.
 Alternative methods of protecting the reinforcement from
 weather may be provided if they are equivalent to the addi-
 tional concrete cover required by the Code. When approved
 by the building oඓcial under the provisions of 1.10, rein-
 forcement with alternative protection from weather may not
 have concrete cover less than the cover required for rein-
 forcement not exposed to weather. 
 Development length provisions given in Chapter 25 are a
 function of cover over the reinforcement. To meet require-
 ments for development length, it may be necessary to use
 cover greater than the minimums speciÜed in 20.5.1.

 to ensure that the concrete Ünish will not spall oඒ, thus 
 resulting in decreased cover. Furthermore, considerations
 for development of reinforcement require minimum mono-

 ty 
 taken as 0.002. Members subjected to only axial compression are consid-
 ered to be compression-controlled and members subjected
 to only axial tension are considered to be tension-controlled.
 If the net tensile strain in the extreme tension reinforce-
 ment is suඓciently large (² ō + 0.003), the section is
 ty 
 deÜned as tension-controlled, for which warning of failure 
 by excessive deÝection and cracking may be expected. The 
 limit ² ō + 0.003 provides suඓcient ductility for most appli-
 ty 
 cations. Before the 2019 Code, the tension-controlled limit
 on ō was deÜned as 0.005 established primarily on the basis 
 t 
 of Grade 60 nonprestressed reinforcement and prestressed
 reinforcement, with some consideration given to higher
 grades of nonprestressed reinforcement (Mast 1992). Begin-
 ning with the 2019 Code, to accommodate nonprestressed
 reinforcement of higher grades, the tension-controlled limit
 on ō in Table 21.2.2 is deÜned as ō + 0.003. This expres-
 t ty 
 sion is consistent with the recommendations of Mast (1992)
 for the general case of reinforcement other than Grade 60,
 and test data show that the expression leads to elements with
 adequate ductility. 
 One condition where greater ductile behavior is required
 is in design for redistribution of moments in continuous
 members and frames, which is addressed in 6.6.5. Because
 redistribution of moment depends on the ductility available
 in the hinge regions, redistribution of moment is limited to
 sections that have a net tensile strain of at least 0.0075.
 If the net tensile strain in the extreme tension reinforce-
 ment is small (± ō ), a brittle compression failure condi-
 ty 
 tion is expected, with little warning of impending failure.
 Before ACI 318-14, the compression-controlled strain
 limit was deÜned as 0.002 for Grade 60 reinforcement 
 and all prestressed reinforcement, but it was not explicitly
 deÜned for other types of reinforcement. The compression-
 controlled strain limit ō is deÜned in 21.2.2.1 and 21.2.2.2 
 ty 
 for deformed and prestressed reinforcement, respectively.
 Beams and slabs are usually tension-controlled, whereas
 columns may be compression-controlled. Some members,
 such as those with small axial forces and large bending
 moments, experience net tensile strain in the extreme tension
 reinforcement between the limits of ō and (ō + 0.003).
 ty ty 
 These sections are in a transition region between compres-
 sion-controlled and tension-controlled. 
 This section speciÜes the appropriate strength reduction 
 factors for tension-controlled and compression-controlled
 sections, and for intermediate cases in the transition region.
 Beginning with the 2019 Code, the expression (ō + 0.003)
 ty 
 deÜnes the limit on ō for tension-controlled behavior in
 t 
 Table 21.2.2. For sections subjected to combined axial force
 and moment, design strengths are determined by multiplying
 both P and M by the appropriate single value of ࣂ.

 CODE COMMENTARY 
 A lower ࣂ-factor is used for compression-controlled
 sections than for tension-controlled sections because
 compression-controlled sections have less ductility, are
 more sensitive to variations in concrete strength, and gener-
 ally occur in members that support larger loaded areas
 than members with tension-controlled sections. Columns
 with spiral reinforcement are assigned a higher ࣂ-factor
 than columns with other types of transverse reinforcement
 because spiral columns have greater ductility and tough-
 ness. For sections within the transition region, the value of ࣂ
 may be determined by linear interpolation, as shown in Fig.

 the strength design method of the Code requires that two
 basic conditions be satisÜed: 1) equilibrium; and 2) compati-

 acting on the cross section at nominal strength. The relation-
 ship between the stress and strain for the concrete and the
 reinforcement at nominal strength is established within the
 design assumptions allowed by 22.2.

 The strain in both nonprestressed reinforcement and
 in concrete is assumed to be directly proportional to the
 distance from the neutral axis. This assumption is of primary
 importance in design for determining the strain and corre-
 sponding stress in the reinforcement.

 22.7—Torsional strength R22.7—Torsional strength 
 The design for torsion in this section is based on a thin-
 walled tube space truss analogy. A beam subjected to torsion
 is idealized as a thin-walled tube with the core concrete cross
 section in a solid beam neglected as shown in Fig. R22.7(a).
 Once a reinforced concrete beam has cracked in torsion, its
 torsional strength is provided primarily by closed stirrups
 and longitudinal bars located near the surface of the member.
 In the thin-walled tube analogy, the strength is assumed to
 be provided by the outer skin of the cross section roughly
 centered on the closed stirrups. Both hollow and solid
 sections are idealized as thin-walled tubes both before and
 after cracking. 
 In a closed thin-walled tube, the product of the shear stress
 ŏ and the wall thickness t at any point in the perimeter is
 known as the shear Ýow, q = ŏt. The shear Ýow q due to
 torsion acts as shown in Fig. R22.7(a) and is constant at
 all points around the perimeter of the tube. The path along
 which it acts extends around the tube at midthickness of the
 walls of the tube. At any point along the perimeter of the
 tube, the shear stress due to torsion is ŏ = T/(2A t), where
 o 
 A is the gross area enclosed by the shear Ýow path, shown 
 o 
 shaded in Fig. R22.7(b), and t is the thickness of the wall at
 the point where ŏ is being calculated. For a hollow member 
 with continuous walls, A includes the area of the hole.
 o 
 The concrete contribution to torsional strength is ignored,
 and in cases of combined shear and torsion, the concrete
 contribution to shear strength does not need to be reduced.
 The design procedure is derived and compared with test
 results in MacGregor and Ghoneim (1995) and Hsu (1997).

 ibility of deformations. This type of torsion is referred to
 as compatibility torsion. 
 For this condition, illustrated in Fig. R22.7.3(b), the
 torsional stiඒness before cracking corresponds to that of 
 the uncracked section according to St. Venant’s theory.
 At torsional cracking, however, a large twist occurs under
 an essentially constant torsional moment, resulting in
 a large redistribution of forces in the structure (Collins
 and Lampert 1973; Hsu and Burton 1974). The cracking
 torsional moment under combined shear, moment, and
 torsion corresponds to a principal tensile stress somewhat
 less than the 4ȹ f′ used in R22.7.5.
 c 
 If the torsional moment exceeds the cracking torsional
 moment (22.7.3.2), a maximum factored torsional moment
 equal to the cracking torsional moment may be assumed to
 occur at the critical sections near the faces of the supports.
 The maximum factored torsional moment has been estab-
 lished to limit the width of torsional cracks.
 Provision 22.7.3.2 applies to typical and regular framing
 conditions. With layouts that impose signiÜcant torsional 
 rotations within a limited length of the member, such as a
 large torsional moment located close to a stiඒ column, or a 
 column that rotates in the reverse directions because of other
 loading, a more detailed analysis is advisable.
 If the factored torsional moment from an elastic analysis
 based on uncracked section properties is between ࣂT and
 th 
 ࣂT , torsional reinforcement should be designed to resist the
 cr 
 calculated torsional moments.

 The frustum should not be confused with the path
 by which a load spreads out as it progresses downward
 through the support. Such a load path would have steeper
 sides. However, the frustum described has somewhat Ýat

 surrounding the zone of high stress at the bearing.
 Where tensile forces occur in the plane of bearing, it may
 be desirable to reduce the allowable bearing stress, provide

 assumes that such a crack will form, and that reinforcement
 is provided across the crack to resist relative displacement
 along it. When shear acts along a crack, one crack face slips
 relative to the other. If the crack faces are rough and irregular,
 this slip is accompanied by separation of the crack faces.
 At nominal strength, the separation is suඓcient to stress, in 
 tension, the reinforcement crossing the crack to its speci-
 Üed yield strength. The reinforcement in tension provides 
 a clamping force A f across the crack faces. The applied

 shear is then resisted by friction between the crack faces,
 by resistance to the shearing oඒ of protrusions on the crack 
 faces, and by dowel action of the reinforcement crossing
 the crack. Successful application of this section depends on
 proper selection of the location of an assumed crack (PCI

 CODE COMMENTARY 
 Design examples for the strut-and-tie method are given in
 ACI SP-208 (Reineck 2002) and ACI SP-273 (Reineck and
 Novak 2010). The process of designing by the strut-and-tie
 method to support the imposed forces acting on and within
 a D-region is referred to as the strut-and-tie method, and it
 includes the following four steps: 
 (1) DeÜne and isolate each D-region.
 (2) Calculate resultant forces on each D-region boundary.
 (3) Select the model and calculate the forces in the struts
 and ties to transfer the resultant forces across the D-region.
 The axes of the struts and ties are chosen to approximately
 coincide with the axes of the compression and tension Üelds, 
 respectively. 
 (4) Design the struts, ties, and nodal zones so that they
 have suඓcient strength. Widths of struts and nodal zones 
 are determined considering the eඒective concrete strengths 
 deÜned in 23.4.3 and 23.9.2. Reinforcement is provided for 
 the ties considering the steel strengths deÜned in 23.7.2. The 
 reinforcement should be anchored in or beyond the nodal
 zones. 
 The components of a strut-and-tie model of a single-span
 deep beam loaded with two concentrated loads are identiÜed 
 in Fig. R23.2.1. The cross-sectional dimensions of a strut or
 tie are designated as thickness and width, and both directions
 are perpendicular to the axis of the strut or tie. Thickness is
 perpendicular to the plane, and width is in the plane of the strut-
 and-tie model. A tie consists of nonprestressed or prestressed
 reinforcement plus a portion of the surrounding concrete that
 is concentric with the axis of the tie. The surrounding concrete
 is included to deÜne the zone in which the forces in the ties 
 are to be anchored. The concrete in a tie is not used to resist
 the axial force in the tie. Although not explicitly considered in
 design, the surrounding concrete will reduce the elongations
 of the tie, especially at service loads.

 CODE COMMENTARY 
 23.2.2 Geometry of the idealized truss shall be consistent R23.2.2 The struts, ties, and nodal zones making up the
 with the dimensions of the struts, ties, nodal zones, bearing strut-and-tie model all have Ünite widths, typically in the 
 areas, and supports. plane of the model, and thicknesses, typically the out-of-
 plane dimension of the structure, which should be taken
 into account in selecting the dimensions of the truss. Figures
 R23.2.2(a) and (b) show a node and the corresponding nodal
 zone. The vertical and horizontal forces equilibrate the
 forces in the inclined strut. 
 If more than three forces act on a nodal zone in a two-
 dimensional strut-and-tie model, as shown in Fig. R23.2.2b,
 it is suggested to resolve some of the forces to form three
 intersecting forces. The strut forces acting on Faces A-E and
 C-E in Fig. R23.2.2(a) can be replaced with one force acting
 on Face A-C as shown in Fig. R23.2.2(b). This force passes
 through the node at D. 
 Alternatively, the strut-and-tie model can be analyzed
 assuming all the strut forces act through the node at D, as
 shown in Fig. R23.2.2(c). In this case, the forces in the two
 struts on the right side of Node D can be resolved into a single
 force acting through Point D, as shown in Fig. R23.2.2(d).
 If the width of the support in the direction perpendicular to
 the member is less than the width of the member, transverse
 reinforcement may be required to restrain vertical splitting
 in the plane of the node. This can be modeled using a trans-
 verse strut-and-tie model. 
 R23.2.3 The analysis results from the strut-and-tie method
 represent lower-bound strength limit states. Section 23.5.1
 requires distributed reinforcement in D-regions designed
 by this chapter unless struts are laterally restrained. Distrib-
 uted reinforcement in D-regions will improve service-
 ability performance. In addition, crack widths in a tie can
 be controlled using 24.3.2, assuming the tie is encased in a
 prism of concrete corresponding to the area of the tie from
 R23.8.1.

 type of node is considered a hydrostatic nodal zone because
 the in-plane stresses are the same in all directions. Strictly
 speaking, this terminology is incorrect because the in-plane
 stresses are not equal to the out-of-plane stresses.
 Figure R23.2.6a(i) shows a C-C-C nodal zone. If the
 stresses on the face of the nodal zone are the same in all
 three struts, the ratios of the lengths of the sides of the nodal
 zone, w :w :w , are in the same proportions as the three

 In deep beams, hairpin bars spliced with the tie reinforce-
 ment can be used to anchor the tie forces at exterior supports,
 provided the beam width is large enough to accommodate
 such bars. 
 Figure R23.8.2 shows two ties anchored at a nodal zone.
 Development is required where the centroid of the tie crosses
 the outline of the extended nodal zone. 
 The development length of the tie reinforcement can be
 reduced through hooks, headed bars, mechanical devices,
 additional conÜnement, or by splicing it with layers of 
 smaller bars.

 rience, to provide vibration performance suitable for human
 comfort under typical service conditions. However, there
 may be situations where serviceability conditions are not
 satisÜed, for example:
 (a) Long spans and open Ýoor plans
 (b) Floors with strict vibration performance requirements
 such as precision manufacturing and laboratory spaces
 (c) Facilities subject to rhythmic loadings or vibrating

 Prestressed Ýoor systems are not subject to the minimum 
 thickness requirements of 7.3, 8.3, and 9.3, and if precast
 they are frequently simple span systems. Consequently,
 these Ýoor systems can be more susceptible to vibration.
 Guidance on the consideration of vibrations in the design
 of Ýoor systems and the evaluation of vibration frequency 
 and amplitude for concrete Ýoor systems is contained in 
 the PCI Design Handbook (PCI MNL 120), ATC Design
 Guide 1 (Applied Technology Council 1999), Mast (2001),
 Fanella and Mota (2014), and Wilford and Young (2006). An
 example application is described by West et al. (2008).

 Two methods are given in the Code for controlling deÝec-

 overall thickness required by 7.3.1 and 9.3.1 is considered
 to satisfy the requirements of the Code for members not
 supporting or attached to nonstructural elements likely to be
 damaged by large deÝections. For nonprestressed two-way 
 construction, the minimum thickness required by 8.3.1 is
 considered to satisfy the requirements of the Code.
 For nonprestressed members that do not meet these
 minimum thickness requirements, for nonprestressed
 one-way members that support or are attached to nonstruc-
 tural elements likely to be damaged by large deÝections, and 
 for prestressed Ýexural members, deÝections are required to

 24.2.4.2.1 Additional time-dependent deÝection of R24.2.4.2.1 Calculation of time-dependent deÝections of

 ering stresses in concrete and reinforcement under sustained calculations should consider not only the increased deÝec-
 load, and the eඒects of creep and shrinkage of concrete and tions due to Ýexural stresses, but also the additional time-
 relaxation of prestressed reinforcement. dependent deÝections resulting from time-dependent short-
 ening of the Ýexural member.
 Prestressed concrete members shorten more with time
 than similar nonprestressed members due to the precompres-
 sion in the slab or beam, which causes creep. This creep,
 together with concrete shrinkage, results in signiÜcant short-
 ening of the Ýexural members that continues for several 
 years after construction and should be considered in design.
 The shortening tends to reduce the tension in the prestressed
 reinforcement, reducing the precompression in the member
 and thereby causing increased time-dependent deÝections.
 Another factor that can inÝuence time-dependent deÝec-
 tions of prestressed Ýexural members is adjacent concrete 
 or masonry that is nonprestressed in the direction of the
 prestressed member. This can be a slab nonprestressed in the
 beam direction adjacent to a prestressed beam or a nonpre-
 stressed slab system. As the prestressed member tends to
 shrink and creep more than the adjacent nonprestressed
 concrete, the structure will tend to reach a compatibility of the
 shortening eඒects. This results in a reduction of the precom-
 pression in the prestressed member as the adjacent concrete
 absorbs the compression. This reduction in precompression
 of the prestressed member can occur over a period of years
 and will result in additional time-dependent deÝections and an 
 increase in tensile stresses in the prestressed member.
 Any suitable method for calculating time-dependent
 deÝections of prestressed members may be used, provided 
 all eඒects are considered. Guidance may be found in ACI
 209R, ACI Committee 435 (1963), Branson et al. (1970),

 crack control where Grade 60 reinforcement is used.
 Extensive laboratory work (Gergely and Lutz 1968; Kaar

 strated that crack width at service loads is proportional to
 reinforcement stress. The signiÜcant variables reÝecting 
 reinforcement detailing were found to be thickness of

 Crack width is inherently subject to wide scatter even
 in careful laboratory work and is inÝuenced by shrinkage

 obtained where the reinforcement is well distributed over the

 occur. Where structural walls or columns provide signiÜ-
 cant restraint to shrinkage and temperature movements, the
 restraint of volume changes causes tension in slabs, as well as
 displacements, shear forces, and Ýexural moments in columns 
 or walls. In these cases, it may be necessary to increase the
 amount of slab reinforcement required by 24.4.3.2 due to the
 shrinkage and thermal eඒects in both principal directions (PCI
 MNL 120; Gilbert 1992). Top and bottom reinforcement are
 both eඒective in controlling cracks. Control strips during the 
 construction period, which permit initial shrinkage to occur
 without causing an increase in stress, are also eඒective in 
 reducing cracks caused by restraint. 
 Topping slabs also experience tension due to restraint of
 diඒerential shrinkage between the topping and the precast 
 elements or metal deck (which has zero shrinkage) that
 should be considered in reinforcing the slab. Consideration
 should be given to strain demands on reinforcement crossing
 joints of precast elements where most of the restraint is

 account for the area of the voids created by the sheathing or
 duct for unbonded prestressed reinforcement. A method for
 evaluating stresses, deÝections, and crack control in cracked 
 prestressed members is given in Mast (1998).
 The precompressed tension zone is that portion of a
 prestressed member where Ýexural tension, calculated using 
 gross section properties, would occur under unfactored
 dead and live loads if the prestress force was not present.
 Prestressed concrete is usually designed so that the prestress
 force introduces compression into this zone, thus eඒectively 
 reducing the magnitude of the tensile stress.
 For corrosive environments, deÜned as an environment in 
 which chemical attack (such as seawater, corrosive indus-
 trial atmosphere, or sewer gas) is encountered, cracking at
 service loads becomes more critical to long-term perfor-
 mance. For these conditions, cover should be increased in
 accordance with 20.5.1.4, and tensile stresses in the concrete
 reduced to minimize possible cracking at service loads.

 25.4.1.1 Calculated tension or compression in reinforce- R25.4.1.1 The development length concept is based on the

 each side of that section by embedment length; hook, headed of the reinforcement (ACI Committee 408 1966). Develop-
 deformed bar, mechanical device, or a combination thereof. ment lengths are required because of the tendency of highly
 stressed bars to split relatively thin sections of restraining
 concrete. A single bar embedded in a mass of concrete
 should not require as great a development length, although
 a row of bars, even in mass concrete, can create a weakened
 plane with longitudinal splitting along the plane of the bars.
 In application, the development length concept requires
 minimum lengths or extensions of reinforcement beyond all
 points of peak stress in the reinforcement. Such peak stresses
 generally occur at the points of maximum stress and points
 where reinforcement is bent or terminated. From a point of
 peak stress in reinforcement, some length of reinforcement
 or anchorage is necessary to develop the stress. This devel-
 opment length or anchorage is necessary on both sides of
 such peak stress points. Often, the reinforcement continues
 for a considerable distance on one side of a critical stress
 point so that calculations need involve only the other side,
 for example, the negative moment reinforcement continuing
 through a support to the middle of the next span. The
 requirement for a minimum value of K along development

 Chapter 17 (Shao et al. 2016). Chapter 17 contains provisions
 for headed anchors related to the individual failure modes
 of concrete breakout, side-face blowout, and pullout. These
 failure modes were considered in the formulation of 25.4.4.2.
 The restrictions to maximum bar size of No. 11 and normal-
 weight concrete are based on a lack of data for larger bars or
 lightweight concrete (Thompson et al. 2005, 2006a,b; Shao
 et al. 2016). The upper limit of 60,000 psi on f that appeared
 y 
 prior to the 2019 Code has been removed.
 For bars in tension, heads allow the bars to be developed in a
 shorter length than required for standard hooks, but otherwise
 perform in a similar manner (Thompson et al. 2005, 2006a,b;
 Shao et al. 2016). The head is considered to be part of the bar
 for the purposes of satisfying the speciÜed cover requirements 
 in 20.5.1.3 and aggregate size requirements of 26.4.2.1(a)(5).
 Headed bars with A < 4A have been used in practice,
 brg b 
 but their performance is not accurately represented by the
 provisions in 25.4.4.2, and they should be used only with
 designs that are supported by test results under 25.4.5. These
 provisions do not address the design of studs or headed stud
 assemblies used for shear reinforcement.

 supporting member, allowing for cover and avoidance of
 interference with column reinforcement, even though the
 resulting anchorage length may exceed ƭ . Extending the
 dt 
 bar to the far side of the column core helps engage the entire
 joint in resisting the anchorage forces and thereby improves
 the performance of the joint. 
 If closely spaced headed bars are used, the potential for
 concrete breakout failure exists. For joints as shown in Fig.
 R25.4.4.2c and R25.4.4.2d, anchorage strengths will be
 generally higher if the anchorage length is equal to or greater
 than d/1.5 (Eligehausen 2006b), as shown in Fig. R25.4.4.2c,
 or by providing reinforcement in the form of hoops and ties to
 establish a load path in accordance with strut-and-tie modeling
 principles, as shown in Fig. R25.4.4.2d. Strut-and-tie models
 should be veriÜed in accordance with Chapter 23. Note that
 the strut-and-tie models illustrated in Fig. R25.4.4.2c and
 R25.4.4.2d rely on a vertical strut from a column extending
 above the joint. Beam-column joints at roof-level and portal
 frames are vulnerable to joint failure and should be properly
 detailed to restrain diagonal cracking through the joint and
 breakout of the bars through the top surface.
 For cases where development length cannot be designed in
 accordance with 25.4.4.2, use of the provisions of Chapter 17
 should be considered.

 25.4.8Development of pretensioned seven-wire strands in R25.4.8Development of pretensioned seven-wire strands 
 tension in tension 
 
 Development requirements for pretensioned strand are
 intended to provide bond integrity for the strength of the
 member. Provisions are based on tests performed on normal-
 weight concrete members with a minimum cover of 2 in.
 These tests may not represent the behavior of strand in
 no-slump concrete. Concrete placement operations should
 ensure consolidation of concrete around the strand with
 complete contact between the steel and concrete.
 The bond of strand is a function of a number of factors,
 including the conÜguration and surface condition of the 
 steel, the stress in the steel, the depth of concrete beneath
 the strand, and the method used to transfer the force in the
 strand to the concrete. For bonded applications, quality
 assurance procedures should be used to conÜrm that the 
 strand is capable of adequate bond (Rose and Russell 1997;
 Logan 1997). The precast concrete manufacturer may rely
 on certiÜcation from the strand manufacturer that the strand 
 has bond characteristics that comply with this section.
 This section does not apply to plain wires, to end-anchored
 tendons, or to unstressed strand. The development length for
 plain wire could be considerably greater due to the absence
 of mechanical interlock. Flexural bond failure would occur
 with plain wire when Ürst slip occurred. Nontensioned 
 prestressing steel is sometimes used as integrity reinforce-
 ment in precast concrete structures; however, there are
 limited data available regarding the bond length required to
 ensure development of the yield strength of the reinforce-
 ment (Salmons and McCrate 1977; PCA 1980).

 embedment lengths twice those required by Eq. (25.4.8.1)
 closely matched the Ýexural performance of similar preten-
 sioned girders with strand fully bonded to ends of girders.
 Accordingly, twice the development length is required for
 strand not bonded through to the end of a member. Subse-
 quent tests (Rabbat et al. 1979) indicated that in preten-
 sioned members designed for zero tension in the concrete
 under service load conditions (refer to 24.5.2), the develop-
 ment length for debonded strands need not be increased by a
 factor of 2. For analysis of sections with debonded strands at
 locations where strand is not fully developed, the procedure
 outlined in 21.2.3 is provided.

 relationship deÜned by Eq. (25.4.8.1). idealized variation of strand stress may be used for analyzing
 sections within the development region (Martin and Korkosz

 Bond research has been primarily related to bars in
 tension. Bond behavior of compression bars is not compli-
 cated by the problem of transverse tension cracking and thus
 compression splices do not require provisions as strict as
 those speciÜed for tension splices.
 Lap splice requirements particular to columns are provided
 in Chapter 10.

 members that may be classiÜed as tension ties are arch ties, 
 hangers carrying load to an overhead supporting structure,
 and main tension elements in a truss. 
 In determining if a member should be classiÜed as a 
 tension tie, consideration should be given to the importance,
 function, proportions, and stress conditions of the member
 related to the above characteristics. For example, a usual
 large circular tank, with many bars and with splices well

 to stagger the individual bar hooks within a bundle.

 hook may be used provided the free end of the 90-degree
 hook is extended the full 12 bar diameters as required in
 25.3.2. Because it is not possible to bend a No. 6, No. 7,
 or No. 8 stirrup tightly around a longitudinal bar and due
 to the force in a bar with a design stress greater than 40,000
 psi, stirrup anchorage depends on both the type of hook and
 whatever development length is provided. A longitudinal bar
 within a stirrup hook limits the width of any Ýexural cracks, 
 even in a tension zone. Because such a stirrup hook cannot
 fail by splitting parallel to the plane of the hooked bar, the
 hook strength as used in 25.4.3.1(a) has been adjusted to
 reÝect cover and conÜnement around the stirrup hook.
 In joists, a small bar or wire can be anchored by a standard
 hook not engaging longitudinal reinforcement, allowing a
 continuously bent bar to form a series of single-leg stirrups
 along the length of the joist.

 wire reinforcement. For anchorage of single-leg welded
 wire reinforcement, the Code permits hooks and embedment
 length in the compression and tension faces of members
 (refer to 25.7.1.3(a) and 25.7.1.4), and embedment only
 in the compression face (refer to 25.7.1.3(b)). This section
 provides for anchorage of straight, single-leg, welded wire
 reinforcement using longitudinal wire anchorage with
 adequate embedment length in compression and tension
 faces of members.

 CODE COMMENTARY 
 26.1—Scope R26.1—Scope 
 This chapter establishes the minimum requirements
 for information that must be included in the construction
 documents as applicable to the project. The requirements
 include information developed in the structural design that
 must be conveyed to the contractor, provisions directing the
 contractor on required quality, and inspection requirements
 to verify compliance with the construction documents.
 Construction and inspection provisions for anchors were
 located in Chapter 17 of the 2014 Code. These provisions
 were moved to Chapter 26 of the 2019 Code.
 This chapter is directed to the licensed design professional
 responsible for incorporating project requirements into
 the construction documents. The construction documents
 should contain all of the necessary design and construction
 requirements for the contractor to achieve compliance with
 the Code. It is not intended that the Contractor will need to
 read and interpret the Code. 
 A general reference in the construction documents
 requiring compliance with this Code is to be avoided because
 the contractor is rarely in a position to accept responsibility
 for design details or construction requirements that depend
 on detailed knowledge of the design. References to speciÜc 
 Code provisions should be avoided as well because it is
 the intention of the Code that all necessary provisions be
 included in the construction documents. For example, refer-
 ences to speciÜc provisions within Chapter 26 are expected 
 to be replaced with the appropriate references within the
 project construction documents. Reference to ACI and
 ASTM standards as well as to other documents is expected.
 This chapter includes provisions for some of the informa-
 tion that is to be in the construction documents. This chapter
 is not intended as an all-inclusive list; additional items may
 be applicable to the Work or required by the building oඓ-
 cial. ACI 301 is a reference construction speciÜcation that is 
 written to be consistent with the requirements of this Code.
 Chapter 26 is organized as shown below:

 professional shall specify in the construction documents, Design information is project speciÜc and developed 
 if applicable. during the structural design. It describes the basis of the
 design or provides information regarding the construction of
 the Work. Only design information that is applicable to the
 Work need be provided. 
 Compliance requirements are general provisions that provide
 a minimum acceptable level of quality for construction of the
 Work. It is not the intent of the Code to require the licensed
 design professional to incorporate verbatim the compliance
 requirements into the construction documents. Some of these
 requirements may not be applicable to a speciÜc project.
 Construction documents that incorporate the minimum
 applicable compliance requirements of this chapter are
 considered to comply with the Code, even if the require-
 ments are stated diඒerently, exceed these minimum require-
 ments, or provide more detail. 
 (c) Inspection requirements that the licensed design R26.1.1(c) Section 26.13 provides inspection provisions
 professional shall specify in the construction documents, to be used in the absence of general building code inspec-
 if applicable. tion provisions. These inspection requirements are intended
 to provide veriÜcation that the Work complies with the 
 construction documents. 
 The inspection requirements of the governing jurisdic-
 tion or the general building code take precedence over
 those included in this chapter. Refer to 26.13.1. ACI 311.4R
 provides guidance for inspection of concrete construction,
 and ACI 311.6 is a reference speciÜcation for testing services 
 for ready mixed concrete.

 CODE COMMENTARY 
 This Code requires explicit documentation to verify that
 concrete made with crushed hydraulic-cement concrete or
 recycled aggregate can consistently provide the mechanical
 properties and durability required in design. Such properties
 may have been calculated or assumed in the design process,
 but may not have been speciÜed in contract documents. 
 SpeciÜc criteria for approval of concrete made with recycled 
 aggregates including crushed hydraulic-cement concrete are
 expected to be unique to each project and set of exposure
 conditions. The project-speciÜc test program and accep-
 tance criteria should be established by the licensed design
 professional. 
 ACI 555R provides information on issues that should be
 considered in verifying required performance.

 (AAR) can occur between the alkali hydroxides in the pore
 solution of concrete and certain components found in some
 aggregates. Two types of AAR are recognized depending
 on the nature of the reactive component: alkali-silica reac-
 tion (ASR), which involves various types of reactive sili-
 ceous minerals; and alkali-carbonate reaction (ACR), which
 involves certain types of aggregates that contain dolomite.
 Both types of reaction can result in expansion and cracking
 of concrete elements under prolonged exposure to moisture,
 leading to a reduction in the structural strength and service
 life of a concrete structure. Options for mitigating ASR,
 including use of supplementary cementitious materials
 or limiting alkali content of the concrete, are provided in

 based on variations in moisture and air content, mixture
 proportion, and type of lightweight aggregate, and should
 be considered when establishing the fresh density that will

 cally speciÜed by Über type, Über length, aspect ratio (ƭ/d),
 and dosage rate (ACI 544.3R). 
 For structural applications, the Code only addresses the
 use of discontinuous deformed steel Übers in resisting shear. 
 For other structural applications where it is desired to use
 discontinuous deformed steel Übers, Section 1.10 provides a
 procedure for approval. Also, there are nonstructural appli-

 the concrete that can impact corrosion, ASTM C1218 is used
 after a period of hydration. The chlorides in some materials,

 should specify whether the bars will be permitted to be bent
 cold or if heating should be used. Bends should be gradual
 and should be straightened as required. 
 Tests (Black 1973; Stecich et al. 1984) have shown that
 ASTM A615 Grade 40 and Grade 60 reinforcing bars can
 be cold bent and straightened up to 90 degrees at or near
 the minimum diameter speciÜed in 25.3. If cracking or
 breakage is encountered, heating to a maximum temperature
 of 1500°F may avoid this condition for the remainder of the
 bars. Bars that fracture during bending or straightening can
 be spliced outside the bend region. 
 Heating should be performed in a manner that will avoid
 damage to the concrete. If the bend area is within approxi-
 mately 6 in. of the concrete, some protective insulation may
 need to be applied. Heating of the bar should be controlled
 by temperature-indicating crayons or other suitable means.
 The heated bars should not be artiÜcially cooled (with water 
 or forced air) until after cooling to at least 600°F.

 Weldability of the steel is based on its carbon equiva-
 lent (CE), calculated from the chemical composition of the
 steel. AWS D1.4 establishes preheat and interpass tempera-
 tures for a range of carbon equivalents and reinforcing bar
 sizes. AWS D1.4 has two expressions for calculating CE.

 CODE COMMENTARY 
 manganese is to be used for bars other than ASTM A706.
 A more comprehensive CE expression is given for ASTM
 A706 bars, which is identical to the CE formula presented
 in ASTM A706. 
 ASTM A706 covers low-alloy steel reinforcing bars
 intended for applications that require controlled tensile
 properties, welding, or both. Weldability is accomplished in
 ASTM A706 by requiring the CE not to exceed 0.55 percent
 and controlling the chemical composition. The manufacturer
 is required by ASTM A706 to report the chemical analysis
 and carbon equivalent (Gustafson and Felder 1991). When
 welding reinforcing bars other than ASTM A706, the
 construction documents should speciÜcally require that the 
 mill test report include chemical analysis results to permit
 calculation of the carbon equivalent. 
 It is often necessary to weld to existing reinforcing bars in
 a structure when no mill test report of the existing reinforce-
 ment is available. This condition is particularly common in
 alterations or building expansions. AWS D1.4 states for such
 bars that a chemical analysis may be performed on repre-
 sentative bars. If the chemical composition is not known or
 obtained, AWS D1.4 requires a minimum preheat. For bars
 other than ASTM A706, the minimum preheat required is
 300°F for No. 6 bars or smaller, and 500°F for No. 7 bars
 or larger. The required preheat for all sizes of ASTM A706
 bars is to be the temperature given in the Welding Code’s
 table for minimum preheat corresponding to the range of CE
 “over 0.45 percent to 0.55 percent.” Welding of the partic-
 ular bars should be performed in accordance with AWS
 D1.4. It should also be determined if additional precautions
 are necessary, based on other considerations such as stress
 level in the bars, consequences of failure, and heat damage
 to existing concrete due to welding operations.
 AWS D1.4 requires the contractor to prepare welding
 procedure speciÜcations (WPSs) conforming to the require-
 ments of the Welding Code. Appendix A in AWS D1.4
 contains a suggested form that shows the information
 required for a WPS. 
 Welding of wire to wire, and of wire or welded wire rein-
 forcement to reinforcing bars or structural steel elements is
 not covered by AWS D1.4. If welding of this type is required
 on a project, the construction documents should specify
 requirements or performance criteria for this welding.
 If cold-drawn wires are to be welded, the welding proce-
 dures should address the potential loss of yield strength
 and ductility achieved by the cold-working process (during
 manufacture) when such wires are heated by welding. These
 potential concerns are not an issue for machine and resis-
 tance welding as used in the manufacture of welded plain
 and deformed wire reinforcement covered by ASTM A1064.

 Hole cleaning is intended to ensure that drilling debris and
 dust do not impair bond. Depending on the Manufacturer’s
 Printed Installation Instructions (MPII), type of qualiÜed 
 anchor, and on-site conditions, hole cleaning may involve
 operations to remove drilling debris from the hole with
 vacuum or compressed air mechanical brushing of the hole
 wall to remove surface dust, and a Ünal step to evacuate any 
 remaining dust or debris, usually with compressed air. If
 wet core drilling is used, holes may be Ýushed with water 
 and then dried with compressed air. Compressed air must be
 free of oil and moisture. For anchors installed in locations
 where the concrete is saturated (for example, outdoor loca-
 tions exposed to rainfall), the resulting drilling mud must
 be removed by other means. In all cases, the procedures
 used should be clearly described by the MPII accompanying
 the product. If the installation procedures are not clearly
 described, contact the manufacturer. These printed installa-
 tion instructions, which also describe the limits on concrete
 temperature and the presence of water during installation

 26.11.1Design of formwork R26.11.1Design of formwork
 Typically, the contractor is responsible for formwork
 design, and the Code provides the minimum formwork
 performance requirements necessary for public health and
 safety. Concrete formwork design, construction, and removal
 demands sound judgment and planning to achieve adequate
 safety. Detailed information on formwork for concrete is
 given in “Guide to Formwork for Concrete” (ACI 347).
 This guide is directed primarily to contractors for design,
 construction, materials for formwork, and forms for unusual
 structures, but it should aid the licensed design professional
 in preparing the construction documents. 
 Formwork for Concrete, ACI SP-4, is a practical hand-
 book for contractors, engineers, and architects. It follows the
 guidelines established in ACI 347 and includes information
 on planning, building, and using formwork. It also includes
 tables, diagrams, and formulas for formwork design loads.
 ACI 301 Section 2 provides speciÜcation requirements for 
 design and construction of formwork.

 Testing three instead of two 4 x 8 in. cylinders preserves the
 conÜdence level of the average strength because 4 x 8 in. cylin-

 variability than 6 x 12 in. cylinders (Carino et al. 1994).
 Representative concrete samples for making strength-
 test specimens are obtained from concrete as delivered to
 the project site. For example, samples of concrete delivered
 in a truck mixer would be obtained from the truck chute at
 discharge. ASTM C172 provides requirements for sampling
 concrete from diඒerent equipment used in the production or

 26.12.6Investigation of strength tests R26.12.6Investigation of strength tests
 26.12.6.1 Compliance requirements: R26.12.6.1 Requirements are provided if strength tests
 have failed to meet the acceptance criterion of 26.12.3.1(a)
 (2) or if the average strengths of Üeld-cured cylinders do 
 not comply with 26.5.3.2(e). These requirements are appli-
 cable only for evaluation of in-place strength at the time of
 construction. Strength evaluation of existing structures is
 covered by Chapter 27. The building oඓcial should apply 
 judgment as to the signiÜcance of low test results and 
 whether they indicate need for concern. If further investi-
 gation is deemed necessary, such investigation may include
 in-place tests as described in ACI 228.1R or, in extreme
 cases, measuring the compressive strength of cores taken
 from the structure. 
 In-place tests of concrete, such as probe penetration
 (ASTM C803), rebound hammer (ASTM C805), or pullout
 test (ASTM C900), may be useful in determining whether
 a portion of the structure actually contains low-strength
 concrete. Unless these in-place tests have been correlated
 with compressive strength using accepted procedures, such
 as described in ACI 228.1R, they are of value primarily for
 comparisons within the same structure rather than as quanti-
 tative estimates of strength. 
 For cores, if required, conservative acceptance criteria are
 provided that should ensure structural adequacy for virtu-
 ally any type of construction (Bloem 1965, 1968; Malhotra
 1976, 1977). Lower strength may be tolerated under many
 circumstances, but this is a matter of judgment on the part of
 the licensed design professional and building oඓcial. If the 
 strengths of cores obtained in accordance with 26.12.6.1(d)
 fail to comply with 26.12.6.1(e), it may be practicable,
 particularly in the case of Ýoor or roof systems, for the 
 building oඓcial to require a strength evaluation as described 
 in Chapter 27. Short of a strength evaluation, if time and
 conditions permit, an eඒort may be made to improve the 
 strength of the concrete in place by supplemental wet curing.
 Eඒectiveness of supplemental curing should be veriÜed by 
 further strength evaluation using procedures previously
 discussed. 
 The Code, as stated, concerns itself with achieving struc-
 tural safety, and the requirements for investigation of low
 strength-test results (26.12.6) are aimed at that objective. It
 is not the function of the Code to assign responsibility for
 strength deÜciencies.

 time of testing provides time for the moisture gradient to
 be reduced. If a water-cooled saw is used for end trimming,
 the conditioning period begins when sawing is completed.
 The maximum time of 7 days between coring and testing
 is intended to ensure timely testing of cores if strength of
 concrete is in question. If end trimming with a water-cooled
 saw is necessary, it should be done within 2 days of drilling
 the core to meet the time limits established by the testing
 criterion. 
 Research (Bartlett and MacGregor 1994) has also shown
 that other moisture conditioning procedures, such as soaking
 or air drying, aඒect measured core strengths and result in 
 conditions that are not representative of the in-place concrete.
 Therefore, to provide reproducible moisture conditions that
 are representative of in-place conditions, a standard mois-
 ture conditioning procedure that permits dissipation of mois-
 ture gradients is prescribed for cores. ASTM C42 permits
 the speciÜer of the tests to modify the default duration of 
 moisture conditioning before testing. The speciÜer of the

 allowed to dissipate.

 the observed result is obviously excessive and incompatible
 with the safety requirements of the structure. No simple rules
 have been developed for application to all types of structures
 and conditions. If suඓcient damage has occurred so that the 
 structure is considered to have failed that test, retesting is not
 permitted because it is considered that damaged members
 should not be put into service even at a lower load rating.
 Local spalling or Ýaking of the compressed concrete in 
 Ýexural members related to casting imperfections need 
 not indicate overall structural distress. Crack widths are
 good indicators of the state of the structure and should be
 observed to help determine whether the structural strength
 and behavior are satisfactory. However, accurate predic-
 tion or measurement of crack widths in structural concrete
 members is not likely to be achieved under Üeld conditions. 
 It is advisable to establish criteria before the test relative
 to the types of cracks anticipated; where the cracks will be
 measured; how they will be measured; and approximate
 limits or criteria to evaluate new cracks or limits for the
 changes in crack width.

 (2017), or LATBSDC (2017). 
 For nonlinear response history analysis, the principles of
 linear superposition do not apply. Therefore, it would be
 incorrect to conduct separate analyses considering various
 loads and then combine the load eඒects. Instead, it is neces-
 sary to conduct an analysis for each factored load combina-
 tion and take the design value as the envelope of the analysis
 results. For any nonlinear analysis including earthquake
 eඒects, gravity loads are to be applied to the model Ürst and 
 then the ground shaking simulations are applied in the pres-
 ence of the gravity loads. 
 There is a low probability that maximum considered earth-
 quake shaking and factored design gravity load combina-
 tions of the general building code will occur simultaneously.
 A more representative load combination is the occurrence of
 expected, realistic gravity loading combined with maximum
 considered earthquake shaking. 
 One load combination is typically considered for analysis,
 which includes expected dead load concurrent with expected
 live load and Maximum Considered Earthquake shaking.
 Chapter 16 of ASCE/SEI 7-16 requires consideration of 
 a second load combination without live load. It should be
 noted that this case will seldom govern the design of a tall
 building. 
 Accidental torsion is not commonly considered in cases
 where linear analysis indicates that torsional irregularities
 are negligible. 
 Load combinations used in the nonlinear analysis may
 diඒer from load combinations used to evaluate force-
 controlled actions (refer to A.11).

 Structural walls that are lightly cracked, including base-

 tive Ýexural stiඒness in the range 0.5 to 1.0 times gross-
 section stiඒness. Diaphragms at major force transfer levels 
 are commonly modeled using eඒective axial stiඒness in the 
 range 0.10 to 0.5 times gross-section stiඒness. TBI (2017)
 and LATBSDC (2017) provide additional eඒective stiඒness 
 recommendations while NIST GCR 17-917-46v1 (NIST

 stiඒness values in Table A.8.4. along the development length. Tabulated values for struc-
 tural walls are appropriate to use where the wall is repre-
 sented by a line element. In some building models, struc-
 tural walls will be represented by distributed Über models, in 
 which case the Über model should directly represent eඒects 
 of concrete cracking and reinforcement yielding, such that
 the stiඒness values in Table A.8.4 do not apply. Basement 
 walls are unlikely to respond at yield-level forces; therefore,
 larger stiඒness values may be more applicable than those 
 in Table A.8.4 for walls. Diaphragm stiඒnesses provided 
 in Table A.8.4 represent typical values. Prestressed and
 nonprestressed diaphragms mainly resisting single-Ýoor 
 in-plane earthquake forces are commonly modeled as rigid,
 as allowed by ASCE/SEI 7. Diaphragms transferring rela-
 tively large in-plane earthquake forces from multiple Ýoor 
 levels can have eඒective stiඒnesses somewhat lower than 
 those represented in Table A.8.4. In cases where analysis
 results are sensitive to diaphragm stiඒness assumptions, it 
 may be prudent to “bound” the solution by analyzing the
 structure using a range of diaphragm stiඒnesses and selecting 
 the design values as the larger forces from the two analyses.
 Coupling beam eඒective stiඒnesses are intended to represent 
 values for beams cast monolithically with Ýoor slabs. Values 
 are based on equations presented by Vu et al. (2014), but are
 adjusted to account for the presence of a slab, diඒerences 
 in modeling approach, and typical shear levels (TBI 2017).
 Engineering judgment should be used to evaluate eඒective 
 shear stiඒness values, noting that due to typical software 
 implementation limitations, gross area is used in lieu of
 eඒective area.

 Suඓcient number of Übers along the cross section should 
 be used to allow the strain values at Über centerlines to be 
 extrapolated to locations where strain values are calculated
 to compare with strain limits, such as, at the extreme edge of
 the wall compression zone. 
 For structural walls or coupling beams modeled using Über 
 elements, deformation acceptance criteria can be represented
 in either a strain or member deformation basis. The strain
 results can be obtained directly from the Über model. The 
 member deformation results, such as plastic hinge rotation,
 story drift, or chord rotation, can be obtained by aggregated
 deformation over a group of Über elements representing the 
 member. Plastic hinge length Eq. (A.10.2a) and (A.10.2b)
 for walls are from Paulay and Priestley (1992).
 An example of acceptance criteria for strain limits is
 provided in TBI (2017). The unconÜned concrete model 
 includes a peak stress at a compressive strain of 0.002, with
 a descending backbone to 50 percent of the peak stress value
 at a compressive strain of 0.003 (the ultimate deformation
 capacity, D ). The conÜned concrete model, used where 
 u 
 conÜnement meeting the requirements of 18.10.6.4(e) and
 (f) are provided, includes a peak stress at a compressive
 strain 0.008, with a descending backbone to 80 percent of
 the peak stress value at a compressive strain of 0.015 (the
 ultimate deformation capacity, D ). The longitudinal rein-
 u 
 forcement tensile strain limit of 0.05 (the ultimate deforma-
 tion capacity, D ) is based on tensile rupture with consider-
 u 
 ation of low-cycle fatigue eඒects, which is corroborated by 
 Segura and Wallace (2018). 
 Additional references for ultimate deformation capacity,
 such as ACI 369.1, TBI (2017), and LATBSDC (2017), may
 be used subject to approval of the independent structural
 design review.
