BUILDING CODE REQUIREMENTS FOR
STRUCTURAL CONCRETE (ACI 318-11)
AND COMMENTARY
REPORTED BY ACI COMMITTEE 318
PREFACE
The “Building Code Requirements for Structural Concrete” (“Code”) covers the materials, design, and construction
of structural concrete used in buildings and where applicable in nonbuilding structures. The Code also covers the
strength evaluation of existing concrete structures.
Among the subjects covered are: contract documents; inspection; materials; durability requirements; concrete
quality, mixing, and placing; formwork; embedded pipes; construction joints; reinforcement details; analysis and
design; strength and serviceability; flexural and axial loads; shear and torsion; development and splices of reinforcement;
slab systems; walls; footings; precast concrete; composite flexural members; prestressed concrete; shells and folded
plate members; strength evaluation of existing structures; provisions for seismic design; structural plain concrete; strut-
and-tie modeling in Appendix A; alternative design provisions in Appendix B; alternative load and strength reduction
factors in Appendix C; and anchoring to concrete in Appendix D.
The quality and testing of materials used in construction are covered by reference to the appropriate ASTM standard
specifications. Welding of reinforcement is covered by reference to the appropriate American Welding Society (AWS)
standard.
Uses of the Code include adoption by reference in general building codes, and earlier editions have been widely used
in this manner. The Code is written in a format that allows such reference without change to its language. Therefore,
background details or suggestions for carrying out the requirements or intent of the Code portion cannot be included.
The Commentary is provided for this purpose. Some of the considerations of the committee in developing the Code
portion are discussed within the Commentary, with emphasis given to the explanation of new or revised provisions.
Much of the research data referenced in preparing the Code is cited for the user desiring to study individual questions
in greater detail. Other documents that provide suggestions for carrying out the requirements of the Code are also cited.
Keywords: admixtures; aggregates; anchorage (structural); beam-column frame; beams (supports); building codes; cements; cold weather construction;

Chapter 22.
Prestressed concrete is included under the definition of
reinforced concrete. Provisions of the Code apply to
prestressed concrete except for those that are stated to apply
specifically to nonprestressed concrete.
Chapter 21 of the Code contains provisions for design and
detailing of earthquake-resistant structures. See 1.1.9.
Appendix A of Codes prior to 2002 contained provisions for
an alternate method of design for nonprestressed reinforced
concrete members using service loads (without load factors)
and permissible service load stresses. The Alternate Design
Method was intended to give results that were slightly more
conservative than designs by the Strength Design Method of
the Code. The Alternate Design Method of the 1999 Code
may be used in place of applicable sections of this Code.
Appendix A of the Code contains provisions for the design
of regions near geometrical discontinuities, or abrupt
changes in loadings.
Appendix B of this Code contains provisions for reinforce-
ment limits based on 0.75ρ , determination of the strength

in the Code for many years, including the 1999 Code. The
provisions are applicable to reinforced and prestressed

Appendix B are equally acceptable as those based on the
body of the Code, provided the provisions of Appendix B
are used in their entirety.

1.3 — Inspection R1.3 — Inspection
The quality of concrete structures depends largely on work-
manship in construction. The best of materials and design
practices will not be effective unless the construction is
performed well. Inspection is necessary to confirm that the
construction is in accordance with the contract documents.
Proper performance of the structure depends on construction
that accurately represents the design and meets code
requirements within the tolerances allowed. Qualification of
the inspectors can be obtained from a certification
program, such as the ACI Certification Program for Concrete
Construction Special Inspector.

construction through other licensed design professionals or
through separate inspection organizations with demonstrated
capability for performing the inspection may be used.
Qualified inspectors should establish their qualification by
becoming certified to inspect and record the results of concrete
construction, including preplacement, placement, and post-
placement operations through the ACI Inspector Certification
Program: Concrete Construction Special Inspector.

design professional responsible for the design, it is recom-
mended that the licensed design professional responsible for
the design be employed at least to oversee inspection and
observe the Work to see that the design requirements are
properly executed.
In some jurisdictions, legislation has established registration
or licensing procedures for persons performing certain
inspection functions. A check should be made in the general
building code or with the building official to ascertain if any
such requirements exist within a specific jurisdiction.
Inspection reports should be promptly distributed to the
owner, licensed design professional responsible for the

design, contractor, appropriate subcontractors, appropriate
suppliers, and the building official to allow timely identifi-
cation of compliance or the need for corrective action.
Inspection responsibility and the degree of inspection
required should be set forth in the contracts between the
owner, architect, engineer, contractor, and inspector.
Adequate fees should be provided consistent with the work
and equipment necessary to properly perform the inspection.

measured by quality assurance tests, quantity, and placement
of the concrete comply with the contract documents; to
counsel on possible ways of obtaining the desired results; to
see that the general system proposed for formwork appears
proper (though it remains the contractor’s responsibility to
design and build adequate forms and to leave them in place
until it is safe to remove them); to see that reinforcement is
properly installed; to see that concrete is delivered as
required and is of the correct quality, properly placed, and
cured; and to see that tests for quality assurance are being
made as specified.
The Code prescribes minimum requirements for inspection
of all structures within its scope. It is not a construction
specification and any user of the Code may require higher
standards of inspection than cited in the legal code if
additional requirements are necessary.
Recommended procedures for organization and conduct of
concrete inspection are given in detail in “Guide for
Concrete Inspection” reported by ACI Committee 311.1.25
(This sets forth procedures relating to concrete construction
to serve as a guide to owners, architects, and engineers in
planning an inspection program.)

Detailed methods of inspecting concrete construction are
given in “ACI Manual of Concrete Inspection” (SP-2)

methods of inspecting concrete construction that are gener-
ally accepted as good practice. Intended as a supplement to
specifications and as a guide in matters not covered by

CODE COMMENTARY
While a wall always encloses or separates spaces, it may
also be used to resist horizontal or vertical forces or
bending. For example, a retaining wall or a basement wall
also supports various combinations of loads.
A column is normally used as a main vertical member carrying
axial loads combined with bending and shear. It may,
however, form a small part of an enclosure or separation.
In the 2008 Code, the definitions for column and pedestal
were revised to provide consistency between the definitions.
Composite concrete flexural members — Concrete
flexural members of precast or cast-in-place concrete
elements, or both, constructed in separate placements
but so interconnected that all elements respond to
loads as a unit.
Compression-controlled section — A cross section
in which the net tensile strain in the extreme tension
steel at nominal strength is less than or equal to the
compression-controlled strain limit.

According to ASTM C567, equilibrium density may be
determined by measurement or approximated by calculation
using either the measured oven-dry density or the oven-dry
density calculated from the mixture proportions. Unless spec-
ified otherwise, ASTM C567 requires that equilibrium density
be approximated by calculation.
By Code definition, sand-lightweight concrete is structural
lightweight concrete with all of the fine aggregate replaced
by sand. This definition may not be in agreement with usage
by some material suppliers or contractors where the
majority, but not all, of the lightweight fines are replaced by
sand. For proper application of the Code provisions, the
replacement limits should be stated, with interpolation when
partial sand replacement is used.

be supplemented to require a report of material
properties necessary to conform to the requirements in Weldability of the steel is based on its chemical composition
AWS D1.4. or carbon equivalent (CE). The Welding Code establishes
preheat and interpass temperatures for a range of carbon
equivalents and reinforcing bar sizes. Carbon equivalent is
calculated from the chemical composition of the reinforcing
bars. The Welding Code has two expressions for calculating
carbon equivalent. A relatively short expression, considering
only the elements carbon and manganese, is to be used for
bars other than ASTM A706 material. A more comprehensive
expression is given for ASTM A706 bars. The CE formula
in the Welding Code for ASTM A706 bars is identical to the
CE formula in ASTM A706.
The chemical analysis, for bars other than ASTM A706,
required to calculate the carbon equivalent is not routinely
provided by the producer of the reinforcing bars. For
welding reinforcing bars other than ASTM A706 bars, the
contract documents should specifically require results of the
chemical analysis to be furnished.
ASTM A706 covers low-alloy steel reinforcing bars intended
for applications requiring controlled tensile properties or
welding. Weldability is accomplished in ASTM A706 by
limits or controls on chemical composition and on carbon
equivalent.3.4 The producer is required by ASTM A706 to
report the chemical composition and carbon equivalent.
The AWS D1.4 Welding Code requires the contractor to
prepare written welding procedure specifications conforming

CODE COMMENTARY
to the requirements of the Welding Code. Appendix A of the
Welding Code contains a suggested form that shows the
information required for such a specification for each joint
welding procedure.
Often it is necessary to weld to existing reinforcing bars in a
structure when no mill test report of the existing reinforce-
ment is available. This condition is particularly common in
alterations or building expansions. AWS D1.4 states for
such bars that a chemical analysis may be performed on
representative bars. If the chemical composition is not
known or obtained, the Welding Code requires a minimum
preheat. For bars other than ASTM A706 material, the
minimum preheat required is 300°F for bars No. 6 or
smaller, and 400°F for No. 7 bars or larger. The required
preheat for all sizes of ASTM A706 is to be the temperature
given in the Welding Code’s table for minimum preheat
corresponding to the range of CE “over 45 percent to 55
percent.” Welding of the particular bars should be
performed in accordance with AWS D1.4. It should also be
determined if additional precautions are in order, based on
other considerations such as stress level in the bars,
consequences of failure, and heat damage to existing
concrete due to welding operations.
Welding of wire to wire, and of wire or welded wire
reinforcement to reinforcing bars or structural steel
elements is not covered by AWS D1.4. If welding of this
type is required on a project, the contract documents should
specify requirements or performance criteria for this
welding. If cold drawn wires are to be welded, the welding
procedures should address the potential loss of yield
strength and ductility achieved by the cold-working process
(during manufacture) when such wires are heated by
welding. These potential concerns are not an issue for
machine and resistance welding as used in the manufacture
of welded plain and deformed wire reinforcement covered by
ASTM A1064.

CHAPTER 4 — DURABILITY REQUIREMENTS

4.1 — General R4.1 — General
Chapters 4 and 5 of earlier editions of the Code were
reformatted in 1989 to emphasize the importance of
considering durability requirements before selecting f′ and

format of Chapter 4 was revised extensively by introducing
exposure categories and classes with applicable durability

inspection is on concrete compressive strength, test results
substantially higher than the specified compressive strength
may lead to a lack of concern for quality and could result in
production and delivery of concrete that exceeds the
maximum w/cm.

amount of mixing water that is absorbed by lightweight
aggregates before concrete sets. This makes the calculation
of the w/cm uncertain. The use of a minimum specified
compressive strength, f′, will ensure the use of a high-

quality cement paste. For normalweight concrete, the use of
both minimum strength and maximum w/cm provide
additional assurance that the paste is of high quality.
4.2 — Exposure categories and classes R4.2 — Exposure categories and classes
Exposure categories defined in Table 4.2.1 are sub-divided
into exposure classes depending on the severity of the
exposure. Associated requirements for concrete relative to
the exposure classes are provided in 4.3.
The Code does not include provisions for especially severe
exposures, such as acids or high temperatures, and is not
concerned with aesthetic considerations such as surface

from Exposure Class S1 to S3 based on the more critical
value of measured water-soluble sulfate concentration in
soil or the concentration of dissolved sulfate in water. Sea
water exposure is classified as Exposure Class S1.
Exposure Category P is subdivided into two exposure
classes: Structural members should be assigned to Exposure
Class P0 when there are no specific permeability require-
ments. Exposure Class P1 is assigned on the basis of the
need for concrete to have a low permeability to water when
the permeation of water into concrete might reduce durability
or affect the intended function of the structural member.
Exposure Class P1 should typically be assigned when other
exposure classes do not apply. An example is an interior
water tank.
Exposure Category C is subdivided into three exposure
classes: Exposure Class C0 is assigned when exposure
conditions do not require additional protection against the
initiation of corrosion of reinforcement. Exposure Classes C1
and C2 are assigned to reinforced and prestressed concrete
members depending on the degree of exposure to external
sources of moisture and chlorides in service. Examples of
external sources of chlorides include concrete in direct
contact with deicing chemicals, salt, salt water, brackish
water, seawater, or spray from these sources.
4.3 — Requirements for concrete mixtures R4.3 — Requirements for concrete mixtures
4.3.1 — Based on the exposure classes assigned from R4.3.1 — Table 4.3.1 gives the requirements for concrete on
Table 4.2.1, concrete mixtures shall comply with the the basis of the assigned exposure classes. When a structural
most restrictive requirements according to Table 4.3.1. concrete member is assigned more than one exposure class,
the most restrictive requirements are applicable. For
example, a prestressed concrete member assigned to Exposure
Class C2 and Exposure Class F3 would require concrete to
comply with a maximum w/cm of 0.40 and minimum f′ of
c
5000 psi, respectively. In this case, the requirement for
corrosion protection is more restrictive than the requirement
for resistance to freezing and thawing.
Exposure Classes F1, F2, and F3: In addition to complying
with a maximum w/cm limit and a minimum strength
requirement, concrete for structural members subject to
freezing-and-thawing exposures should be air entrained in
accordance with 4.4.1. Structural members assigned to
Exposure Class F3 are additionally required to comply with
the limitations on the quantity of pozzolans and slag in the
composition of the cementitious materials as given in 4.4.2.
Exposure Classes S1, S2, and S3: Concrete exposed to
injurious concentrations of sulfates from soil and water
should be made with sulfate-resisting cement. Table 4.3.1
lists the appropriate types of cement and the maximum w/cm
and minimum specified compressive strengths for various
exposure conditions. In selecting cement for sulfate resistance,
the principal consideration is its tricalcium aluminate (C A)

STRUCTURAL CONCRETE BUILDING CODE (ACI 318-11) AND COMMENTARY 61
CODE COMMENTARY
Exposure Class C2: For reinforced and prestressed
concrete in Exposure Class C2, the maximum w/cm,
minimum specified compressive strength, and minimum
cover are the basic requirements to be considered. Condi-
tions in structures where chlorides may be applied should be
evaluated, such as in parking structures where chlorides
may be tracked in by vehicles, or in structures near
seawater. Epoxy- or zinc-coated bars or cover greater than
the minimum required in 7.7 may be desirable. Use of slag
meeting ASTM C989 or fly ash meeting ASTM C618 and
increased levels of specified compressive strength provide
increased protection. Use of silica fume meeting ASTM
C1240 with an appropriate high-range water reducer,
ASTM C494, Types F and G, or ASTM C1017 can also
provide additional protection.4.4 The use of ASTM C12024.5
to test concrete mixtures proposed for use will provide
additional information on the performance of the mixtures.
Exposure Classes C0, C1, and C2: For Exposure Classes C0,
C1, and C2, the chloride ion limits apply. For reinforced
concrete, the permitted maximum amount of water-soluble
chloride ions incorporated into the concrete, measured by
ASTM C1218 at ages between 28 and 42 days, depend on
the degree of exposure to an anticipated external source of
moisture and chlorides. For prestressed concrete, the same
limit of 0.06 percent chloride ion by weight of cement
applies regardless of exposure.
Additional information on the effects of chlorides on the
corrosion of reinforcing steel is given in ACI 201.2R,4.6
which provides guidance on concrete durability, and ACI
222R,4.7 which provides guidance on factors that impact
corrosion of metals in concrete. An initial evaluation of the
chloride ion content of the proposed concrete mixture may
be obtained by testing individual concrete ingredients for
total chloride ion content. If total chloride ion content,
calculated on the basis of concrete proportions, exceeds
those permitted in Table 4.3.1, it may be necessary to test
samples of the hardened concrete for water-soluble chloride
ion content. Some of the chloride ions present in the ingre-
dients will either be insoluble in water or will react with the
cement during hydration and become insoluble under the
test procedures described in ASTM C1218.
When concretes are tested for water-soluble chloride ion
content, the tests should be made at an age of 28 to 42 days.
The limits in Table 4.3.1 are to be applied to chlorides contrib-
uted from the concrete ingredients, not those from the environ-
ment surrounding the concrete. For reinforced concrete that
will be dry in service (Exposure Class C0), a limit of 1 percent
has been included to control the water-soluble chlorides intro-
duced by concrete-making materials. Table 4.3.1 includes
limits of 0.30 and 0.15 percent for reinforced concrete subject
to Exposure Classes C1 and C2, respectively.

CHAPTER 5 — CONCRETE QUALITY, MIXING, AND PLACING
CODE COMMENTARY
5.1 — General R5.1 — General
The requirements for proportioning concrete mixtures are
based on the philosophy that concrete should provide both
adequate durability (Chapter 4) and strength. The criteria
for acceptance of concrete are based on the philosophy that
the Code is intended primarily to protect the safety of the
public. Chapter 5 describes procedures by which concrete of
adequate strength can be obtained, and provides procedures
for checking the quality of the concrete during and after its
placement in the Work.
Chapter 5 also prescribes minimum criteria for mixing and
placing concrete.
The provisions of 5.2, 5.3, and 5.4, together with Chapter 4,
establish required mixture proportions. The basis for deter-
mining the adequacy of concrete strength is in 5.6.

5.2 — Selection of concrete proportions R5.2 — Selection of concrete proportions
Recommendations for selecting proportions for concrete are
given in detail in ACI 211.1.5.1 (This provides two methods
for selecting and adjusting proportions for normalweight
concrete: the estimated weight and absolute volume
methods. Example calculations are shown for both methods.
Proportioning of heavyweight concrete by the absolute
volume method is presented in an appendix.)
Recommendations for lightweight concrete are given in ACI

adjusting structural grade concrete containing lightweight
aggregates.)

In selecting a suitable concrete mixture there are three basic
steps. The first is the determination of the sample standard
deviation. The second is the determination of the required
average compressive strength. The third is the selection of
mixture proportions required to produce that average
strength, either by conventional trial mixture procedures or
by a suitable experience record. Figure R5.3 is a flow chart
outlining the mixture selection and documentation procedure.
The mixture selected should yield an average strength
appreciably higher than the specified strength f′. The
c
degree of mixture over design depends on the variability of
the test results.

conditions “similar to those expected” [see 5.3.1.1(a)]. This
requirement is important to ensure acceptable concrete.
Concrete for background tests to determine sample standard
deviation is considered to be “similar” to that required if
made with the same general types of ingredients under no
more restrictive conditions of control over material quality
and production methods than on the proposed Work, and if
its specified strength does not deviate more than 1000 psi
from the f′ required [see 5.3.1.1(b)]. A change in the type
c
of concrete or a major increase in the strength level may
increase the sample standard deviation. Such a situation
might occur with a change in type of aggregate (i.e., from
natural aggregate to lightweight aggregate or vice versa) or
a change from non-air-entrained concrete to air-entrained
concrete. Also, there may be an increase in sample standard
deviation when the average strength level is raised by a
significant amount, although the increment of increase in
sample standard deviation should be somewhat less than
directly proportional to the strength increase. When there is
reasonable doubt, any estimated sample standard deviation
used to calculate the required average strength should
always be on the conservative (high) side.
Note that the Code uses the sample standard deviation in
pounds per square inch instead of the coefficient of variation
in percent. The latter is equal to the former expressed as a
percent of the average strength.
Even when the average strength and sample standard deviation
are of the levels assumed, there will be occasional tests that
fail to meet the acceptance criteria prescribed in 5.6.3.3
(perhaps one test in 100).

Once the mixture proportions have been selected and the job

The Code requires testing reports to be distributed to the
parties responsible for the design, construction, and
approval of the work. Such distribution of test reports
should be indicated in contracts for inspection and testing
services. Prompt distribution of testing reports allows for
timely identification of either compliance or the need for
corrective action. A complete record of testing allows the
concrete producer to reliably establish the required average

strength as described in 5.3.
If fewer than 15 tests have been made on the class of
concrete in question, the new target strength level should be
at least as great as the average level used in the initial selection
of proportions. If the average of the available tests made on
the project equals or exceeds the level used in the initial
selection of proportions, a further increase in average level
is required.
The steps taken to increase the average level of test results
will depend on the particular circumstances, but could
include one or more of the following:
(a) An increase in cementitious materials content;
(b) Changes in mixture proportions;
(c) Reductions in or better control of levels of slump
supplied;
(d) A reduction in delivery time;
(e) Closer control of air content;
(f) An improvement in the quality of the testing, including
strict compliance with standard test procedures.
Such changes in operating and testing procedures, or
changes in cementitious materials content, or slump should
not require a formal resubmission under the procedures of
5.3; however, important changes in sources of cement,
aggregates, or admixtures should be accompanied by
evidence that the average strength level will be improved.

testing provides a minimum time for the moisture gradient
to dissipate. The maximum time between coring and testing
is intended to ensure timely testing of cores when strength
of concrete is in question. Research5.11 has also shown that
procedures for soaking or drying cores that were required
before ACI 318-02 affect measured compressive strength
and result in conditions that are not representative of
structures that are dry or wet in service. Thus, to provide
reproducible moisture conditions that are representative of
in-place conditions, a common moisture conditioning
procedure that permits dissipation of moisture gradients is
prescribed for cores. ASTM C42 permits the specifier of
tests to modify the default duration of moisture conditioning
before testing.
Core tests having an average of 85 percent of the specified
strength are realistic. To expect core tests to be equal to f′ is
c
not realistic, since differences in the size of specimens,
conditions of obtaining samples, and procedures for curing,
do not permit equal values to be obtained.
The Code, as stated, concerns itself with assuring structural
safety, and the instructions in 5.6 are aimed at that objective.
It is not the function of the Code to assign responsibility for
strength deficiencies, whether or not they are such as to
require corrective measures.
Under the requirements of this section, cores taken to
confirm structural adequacy will usually be taken at ages
later than those specified for determination of f′.

field-cured cylinders should produce strength not less than
85 percent of that of the standard, laboratory-cured cylinders.
For a reasonably valid comparison to be made, field-cured
cylinders and companion laboratory-cured cylinders should
come from the same sample. Field-cured cylinders should
be cured under conditions identical to those of the structure.
If the structure is protected from the elements, the cylinder
should be protected.
Cylinders related to members not directly exposed to
weather should be cured adjacent to those members and
provided with the same degree of protection and method of
curing. The field cylinders should not be treated more
favorably than the elements they represent. (See 5.6.4 for
additional information.) If the field-cured cylinders do not
provide satisfactory strength by this comparison, measures
should be taken to improve the curing. If the tests indicate a

Heating should be performed in a manner that will avoid

deflection of the roof due to the dead loads, or the loads

However, the effects of all partition walls attached to the

moments above or below elastically calculated values,
within specified limits. A decrease in negative moment
strength implies inelastic behavior in the negative moment
region at the support. By increasing the negative moment
strength, the positive moments can be reduced but the result
is that inelastic behavior will occur in the positive moment
region of the member and the percentage change in the positive
moment section could be much larger than the 20 percent
permitted for negative moment sections.8.3 The 2008
change places the same percentage limitations on both
positive and negative moments.
Using conservative values of limiting concrete strains and
lengths of plastic hinges derived from extensive tests, flex-
ural members with small rotation capacity were analyzed
for moment redistribution up to 20 percent, depending on
the reinforcement ratio. The results were found to be
conservative (see Fig. R8.4). Studies by Cohn8.4 and
Mattock8.5 support this conclusion and indicate that
cracking and deflection of beams designed for moment
redistribution are not significantly greater at service loads
than for beams designed by the elastic theory distribution of
moments. Also, these studies indicated that adequate rotation
capacity for the moment redistribution allowed by the Code is
available if the members satisfy the Code requirements.

Moment redistribution as permitted by 8.4 is not intended

using the pattern loadings given in 13.7.6.3 or for use where
approximate values of bending moments are used. For the
Direct Design Method, 10 percent modification is allowed
by 13.6.7.
Before 2002, Section 8.4 specified the permissible redistri-
bution percentage in terms of reinforcement indices. The
2002 Code specified the permissible redistribution
percentage in terms of the net tensile strain in extreme
tension steel at nominal strength, ε. See Reference 8.6 for a

Two conditions determine whether it is necessary to consider
torsional stiffness in the analysis of a given structure: (1) the
relative magnitude of the torsional and flexural stiffnesses,
and (2) whether torsion is required for equilibrium of the
structure (equilibrium torsion) or is due to members twisting to
maintain deformation compatibility (compatibility torsion).
In the case of compatibility torsion, the torsional stiffness

torsional stiffness should be considered.

wind loading, where it is desirable to prevent nonlinear

loading, a level of nonlinear behavior is tolerable depending
on the intended structural performance and earthquake

Varying degrees of confidence can be obtained from a
simple linear analysis based on the computational rigor used
to define the effective stiffness of each member. One option
that considers the reduced stiffness of the elements is to
calculate the secant stiffness value to the point of yielding of
reinforcement for the member, or the secant value to a point
before yielding of the reinforcement if analysis demonstrates
yielding is not expected for the given loading condition. The

designs will be different, but the results of either set of load

Chapter 9 defines the basic strength and serviceability
conditions for proportioning structural concrete members.
The basic requirement for strength design may be expressed
as follows:
Design Strength ≥ Required Strength
φ (Nominal Strength) ≥ U
In the strength design procedure, the margin of safety is
provided by multiplying the service load by a load factor
and the nominal strength by a strength reduction factor.

is particularly true when strength is dependent on more than
one load effect, such as strength for combined flexure and
axial load or shear strength in members with axial load.
If unusual circumstances require greater reliance on the
strength of particular members than encountered in usual
practice, some reduction in the stipulated strength reduction
factors φ or increase in the stipulated load factors may be
appropriate for such members.
In 2011, the Code removed the weight of soil and other fill
materials as part of the definition of H. Consistent with
ASCE/SEI 7-10, the weight of these materials is part of
dead load, D. The load factors for D are appropriate
provided the unit weight and thickness of earth or other fill
materials are well controlled. If the weight of earth stabilizes
the structure, a load factor of zero may be appropriate.
R9.2.1(a) — The load modification factor of 9.2.1(a) is
different than the live load reductions based on the loaded
area that may be allowed in the legally adopted general
building code. The live load reduction, based on loaded
area, adjusts the nominal live load (L in ASCE/SEI 7) to L.

The live load reduction as specified in the legally adopted
general building code can be used in combination with the
0.5 load factor specified in 9.2.1(a).
R9.2.1(b) — ASCE/SEI 7-10 has converted wind loads to
strength level, and reduced the wind load factor to 1.0. ACI
318 requires use of the previous load factor for wind loads,
1.6, when service-level wind loads are used. For service-

use of the previous load factor for earthquake effects, approx-

degree of ductility and required reliability of the member
under the load effects being considered, and (4) to reflect

In the 2002 Code, the strength reduction factors were
adjusted to be compatible with the SEI/ASCE 79.1 load
combinations, which were the basis for the required
factored load combinations in model building codes at that
time. These factors are essentially the same as those published
in Appendix C of the 1995 edition, except the factor for
flexure/tension controlled limits is increased from 0.80 to
0.90. This change was based on reliability analyses,9.8,9.10
statistical study of material properties, as well as the opinion
of the committee that the historical performance of concrete
structures supports φ = 0.90. In 2008, φ for spirally reinforced
compression-controlled sections was revised based on the
reliability analyses reported in Reference 9.11 and the
superior performance of such members when subjected to
excessive demand as documented in Reference 9.12.

9.5.4.3 — Additional long-term deflection of R9.5.4.3 — Calculation of long-term deflections of
prestressed concrete members shall be computed prestressed concrete flexural members is complicated. The
taking into account stresses in concrete and steel calculations should consider not only the increased deflections
under sustained load and including effects of creep due to flexural stresses, but also the additional long-term
and shrinkage of concrete and relaxation of steel. deflections resulting from time-dependent shortening of the
flexural member.
Prestressed concrete members shorten more with time than
similar nonprestressed members due to the precompression
in the slab or beam, which causes axial creep. This creep
together with concrete shrinkage results in significant short-
ening of the flexural members that continues for several
years after construction and should be considered in design.
The shortening tends to reduce the tension in the prestressing
steel, reducing the precompression in the member and thereby
causing increased long-term deflections.
Another factor that can influence long-term deflections of
prestressed flexural members is adjacent concrete or masonry
that is nonprestressed in the direction of the prestressed
member. This can be a slab nonprestressed in the beam
direction adjacent to a prestressed beam or a nonprestressed
slab system. As the prestressed member tends to shrink and
creep more than the adjacent nonprestressed concrete, the
structure will tend to reach a compatibility of the shortening
effects. This results in a reduction of the precompression in
the prestressed member as the adjacent concrete absorbs the
compression. This reduction in precompression of the
prestressed member can occur over a period of years and
will result in additional long-term deflections and in
increase tensile stresses in the prestressed member.
Any suitable method for calculating long-term deflections
of prestressed members may be used, provided all effects
are considered. Guidance may be found in References 9.19,
9.28, 9.29, and 9.30.

is neglected in strength design. For members with normal

rising curve from zero to a maximum at a compressive
strain between 0.0015 and 0.002 followed by a descending
curve to an ultimate strain (crushing of the concrete) from
0.003 to higher than 0.008. As discussed under R10.2.3, the
Code sets the maximum usable strain at 0.003 for design.
The actual distribution of concrete compressive stress is
complex and usually not known explicitly. Research has
shown that the important properties of the concrete stress
distribution can be approximated closely using any one of
several different assumptions as to the form of stress distri-
bution. The Code permits any particular stress distribution
to be assumed in design if shown to result in predictions of
ultimate strength in reasonable agreement with the results of
comprehensive tests. Many stress distributions have been
proposed. The three most common are the parabola, trapezoid,

failure. Flexural members are usually tension-controlled,
whereas compression members are usually compression-
controlled. Some sections, such as those with small axial load
and large bending moment, will have net tensile strain in the
extreme tension steel between the above limits. These sections
are in a transition region between compression- and tension-
controlled sections. Section 9.3.2 specifies the appropriate
strength reduction factors for tension-controlled and
compression-controlled sections, and for intermediate cases
in the transition region.
Before the development of these provisions, the limiting
tensile strain for flexural members was not stated, but was
implicit in the maximum tension reinforcement ratio that
was given as a fraction of ρ , which was dependent on the
b
yield strength of the reinforcement. The net tensile strain
limit of 0.005 for tension-controlled sections was chosen to
be a single value that applies to all types of steel
(prestressed and nonprestressed) permitted by this Code.
Unless unusual amounts of ductility are required, the 0.005
limit will provide ductile behavior for most designs. One
condition where greater ductile behavior is required is in
design for redistribution of moments in continuous members
and frames. Section 8.4 permits redistribution of moments.
Since moment redistribution is dependent on adequate
ductility in hinge regions, moment redistribution is limited to
sections that have a net tensile strain of at least 0.0075.
For beams with compression reinforcement, or T-beams, the
effects of compression reinforcement and flanges are automati-
cally accounted for in the computation of net tensile strain ε.

Mat foundations and other slabs that help support the structure

In reevaluating the overall treatment of 10.5, the maximum
spacing for reinforcement in structural slabs (including
footings) was reduced from the 5h for temperature and
shrinkage reinforcement to the compromise value of 3h,
which is somewhat larger than the 2h limit of 13.3.2 for

stresses, however, visible cracks should be expected, and
steps should be taken in detailing of the reinforcement to
control cracking. For reasons of durability and appearance,
many fine cracks are preferable to a few wide cracks.
Control of cracking is particularly important when reinforce-
ment with a yield strength in excess of 40,000 psi is used.
Current good detailing practices will usually lead to
adequate crack control even when reinforcement of 60,000 psi
yield strength is used.
Extensive laboratory work10.12-10.14 involving deformed
bars has confirmed that crack width at service loads is
proportional to steel stress. The significant variables
reflecting steel detailing were found to be thickness of
concrete cover and the spacing of reinforcement.
Crack width is inherently subject to wide scatter even in
careful laboratory work and is influenced by shrinkage and
other time-dependent effects. Improved crack control is
obtained when the steel reinforcement is well distributed
over the zone of maximum concrete tension.

CODE COMMENTARY
Minimum reinforcement — Since the design methods for
columns incorporate separate terms for the load carried by
concrete and by reinforcement, it is necessary to specify
some minimum amount of reinforcement to ensure that only
reinforced concrete columns are designed by these procedures.
Reinforcement is necessary to provide resistance to
bending, which may exist whether or not computations
show that bending exists, and to reduce the effects of creep
and shrinkage of the concrete under sustained compressive
stresses. Tests have shown that creep and shrinkage tend to
transfer load from the concrete to the reinforcement, with a
consequent increase in stress in the reinforcement, and that
this increase is greater as the ratio of reinforcement
decreases. Unless a lower limit is placed on this ratio, the
stress in the reinforcement may increase to the yield level
under sustained service loads. This phenomenon was
emphasized in the report of ACI Committee 10510.26 and
minimum reinforcement ratios of 0.01 and 0.005 were
recommended for spiral and tied columns, respectively.
However, in all editions of the Code since 1936, the
minimum ratio has been 0.01 for both types of transversely
reinforced columns.
Maximum reinforcement — Extensive tests of the ACI
column investigation10.26 included reinforcement ratios no
greater than 0.06. Although other tests with as much as 17
percent reinforcement in the form of bars produced results
similar to those obtained previously, it is necessary to note
that the loads in these tests were applied through bearing
plates on the ends of the columns and the problem of trans-
ferring a proportional amount of the load to the bars was
thus minimized or avoided. Maximum ratios of 0.08 and
0.03 were recommended by ACI Committee 10510.26 for spiral
and tied columns, respectively. In the 1936 Code, these limits
were made 0.08 and 0.04, respectively. In the 1956 Code,
the limit for tied columns with bending was raised to 0.08.
Since the 1963 Code, it has been required that bending be
considered in the design of all columns, and the maximum
ratio of 0.08 has been applied to both types of columns. This
limit can be considered a practical maximum for reinforce-
ment in terms of economy and requirements for placing.

When the number of bars in a circular arrangement is less
than eight, the orientation of the bars will affect the moment
strength of eccentrically loaded columns and should be
considered in design.

nation of the concrete deliveries and the possible use of
retarders. In some cases, additional inspection services will
be required when this procedure is used. It is important that
the higher-strength concrete in the floor in the region of the
column be placed before the lower-strength concrete in the
remainder of the floor to prevent accidental placing of the
low-strength concrete in the column area. It is the responsi-
bility of the licensed design professional to indicate on the
contract documents where the high- and low-strength
concretes are to be placed.
Beginning with the 1983 Code, the amount of column
concrete to be placed within the floor is expressed as a
simple 2 ft extension from face of the column. Since the
concrete placement requirement should be carried out in the
field, it is now expressed in a way that is directly evident to
workers. The new requirement will also locate the interface
between column and floor concrete farther out into the floor,
away from regions of very high shear.

joists when the transverse reinforcement satisfied an
increased value for the minimum amount of web reinforce-
ment. There are limited test data on the two-way shear
strength of high-strength concrete slabs. Until more experience
is obtained for two-way slabs built with concretes that have
strengths greater than 10,000 psi, it is prudent to limit f′

distance d. from the face of the support. If loads are applied to the top of
this beam, the stirrups across this crack are stressed by loads
acting on the lower freebody in Fig. R11.1.3.1(a). The loads
applied to the beam between the face of the column and the
point d away from the face are transferred directly to the
support by compression in the web above the crack.
Accordingly, the Code permits design for a maximum
factored shear force V at a distance d from the support for
u
nonprestressed members, and at a distance h/2 for
prestressed members. Two things are emphasized: first,
stirrups are required across the potential crack designed for the
shear at d from the support, and second, a tension force exists
in the longitudinal reinforcement at the face of the support.
In Fig. R11.1.3.1(b), loads are shown acting near the bottom of
a beam. In this case, the critical section is taken at the face of
the support. Loads acting near the support should be transferred
across the inclined crack extending upward from the support
face. The shear force acting on the critical section should
include all loads applied below the potential inclined crack.
Typical support conditions where the shear force at a
distance d from the support may be used include: (1)

members framing monolithically into another member as
illustrated in Fig. R11.1.3.1(d).
Support conditions where this provision should not be
applied include: (1) Members framing into a supporting
member in tension, such as shown in Fig. R11.1.3.1(e). For
this case, the critical section for shear should be taken at the
face of the support. Shear within the connection should also
be investigated and special corner reinforcement should be
provided. (2) Members for which loads are not applied at or
near the top of the member. This is the condition referred to in
Fig. 11.1.3.1(b). For such cases, the critical section is taken at
the face of the support. Loads acting near the support should
be transferred across the inclined crack extending upward
from the support face. The shear force acting on the critical
section should include all loads applied below the potential
inclined crack. (3) Members loaded such that the shear at
sections between the support and a distance d from the
support differs radically from the shear at distance d. This
commonly occurs in brackets and in beams where a concen-
trated load is located close to the support, as shown in
Fig. R11.1.3.1(f) or in footings supported on piles. In this
case, the shear at the face of the support should be used.

Web-shear cracking begins from an interior point in a
member when the principal tensile stresses exceed the
tensile strength of the concrete. Flexure-shear cracking is
initiated by flexural cracking. When flexural cracking
occurs, the shear stresses in the concrete above the crack are
increased. The flexure-shear crack develops when the
combined shear and tensile stress exceeds the tensile
strength of the concrete.
Equations (11-10) and (11-12) may be used to determine the
shear forces causing flexure-shear and web-shear cracking,
respectively. The nominal shear strength provided by the
concrete V is assumed equal to the lesser of V and V .

Even when V is less than 0.5φV , the use of some web

reinforcement is recommended in all thin-web post-
tensioned prestressed concrete members (joists, waffle
slabs, beams, and T-beams) to reinforce against tensile
forces in webs resulting from local deviations from the
design tendon profile, and to provide a means of supporting
the tendons in the design profile during construction. If
sufficient support is not provided, lateral wobble and local
deviations from the smooth parabolic tendon profile
assumed in design may result during placement of the
concrete. In such cases, the deviations in the tendons tend to
straighten out when the tendons are stressed. This process
may impose large tensile stresses in webs, and severe
cracking may develop if no web reinforcement is provided.
Unintended curvature of the tendons, and the resulting
tensile stresses in webs, may be minimized by securely
tying tendons to stirrups that are rigidly held in place by
other elements of the reinforcing cage and held down in the
forms. The maximum spacing of stirrups used for this
purpose should not exceed the smaller of 1.5h or 4 ft. When
applicable, the shear reinforcement provisions of 11.4.5 and
11.4.6 will require closer stirrup spacings.
For repeated loading of flexural members, the possibility of
inclined diagonal tension cracks forming at stresses appre-
ciably smaller than under static loading should be taken into
account in the design. In these instances, it would be prudent
to use at least the minimum shear reinforcement expressed by
Eq. (11-13) or (11-14), even though tests or calculations based
on static loads show that shear reinforcement is not required.

of the member. In the thin-walled tube analogy, the resistance
is assumed to be provided by the outer skin of the cross
section roughly centered on the closed stirrups. Both hollow
and solid sections are idealized as thin-walled tubes both
before and after cracking.
In a closed thin-walled tube, the product of the shear stress τ
and the wall thickness t at any point in the perimeter is
known as the shear flow, q = τt. The shear flow q due to
torsion acts as shown in Fig. R11.5(a) and is constant at all
points around the perimeter of the tube. The path along
which it acts extends around the tube at midthickness of the
walls of the tube. At any point along the perimeter of the
tube the shear stress due to torsion is τ = T/(2A t) where A
o o
is the gross area enclosed by the shear flow path, shown
shaded in Fig. R11.5(b), and t is the thickness of the wall at
the point where τ is being computed. The shear flow follows
the midthickness of the walls of the tube and A is the area

about 25 percent. This reduction was judged to be excessive.

(b) The torsional moment can be reduced by redistribu-
tion of internal forces after cracking (11.5.2.2) if the
torsion arises from the member twisting to maintain
compatibility of deformations. This type of torsion is
referred to as compatibility torsion.
For this condition, illustrated in Fig. R11.5.2.2, the
torsional stiffness before cracking corresponds to that of
the uncracked section according to St. Venant’s theory. At
torsional cracking, however, a large twist occurs under an
essentially constant torque, resulting in a large redistribution
of forces in the structure.11.34,11.35 The cracking torque
under combined shear, flexure, and torsion corresponds to
a principal tensile stress somewhat less than the 4λ f′
c
quoted in R11.5.1.
When the torsional moment exceeds the cracking torque, a
maximum factored torsional moment equal to the cracking
torque may be assumed to occur at the critical sections near
the faces of the supports. This limit has been established to
control the width of torsional cracks. The replacement of A
cp
with A , as in the calculation of the threshold torque for hollow
g
sections in 11.5.1, is not applied here. Thus, the torque after
redistribution is larger and hence more conservative.

Section 11.5.2.2 applies to typical and regular framing
conditions. With layouts that impose significant torsional
rotations within a limited length of the member, such as a
heavy torque loading located close to a stiff column, or a
column that rotates in the reverse directions because of
other loading, a more exact analysis is advisable.
When the factored torsional moment from an elastic analysis

reinforcement should be designed to resist the computed

Since the shear-friction reinforcement acts in tension, it
should have full tensile anchorage on both sides of the shear

potential crack may pass between the shear-friction reinforce-
ment and the body of the concrete. This requirement applies
particularly to welded headed studs used with steel inserts
for connections in precast and cast-in-place concrete.

The fraction of the unbalanced moment between slab and
column not transferred by eccentricity of the shear should
be transferred by flexure in accordance with 13.5.3. A
conservative method assigns the fraction transferred by
flexure over an effective slab width defined in 13.5.3.2.
Often column strip reinforcement is concentrated near the
column to accommodate this unbalanced moment. Available
test data11.71 seem to indicate that this practice does not
increase shear strength but may be desirable to increase the
stiffness of the slab-column junction.
Test data11.72 indicate that the moment transfer strength of a
prestressed slab-to-column connection can be calculated
using the procedures of 11.11.7 and 13.5.3.
Where shear reinforcement has been used, the critical section

affect detailing of reinforcement, structural integrity
requirements of 7.13 shall be satisfied. The development length concept is based on the attainable
average bond stress over the length of embedment of the
reinforcement. Development lengths are required because of
the tendency of highly stressed bars to split relatively thin
sections of restraining concrete. A single bar embedded in a
mass of concrete should not require as great a development
length; although a row of bars, even in mass concrete, can
create a weakened plane with longitudinal splitting along
the plane of the bars.
In application, the development length concept requires
minimum lengths or extensions of reinforcement beyond all
points of peak stress in the reinforcement. Such peak
stresses generally occur at the points in 12.10.2.
Structural integrity requirements of 7.13 may control
detailing of reinforcement at splices and terminations.
The strength reduction factor φ is not used in the develop-
ment length and lap splice equations. An allowance for
strength reduction is already included in the expressions for
determining development and splice lengths. Units of
measurement are given in the Notation to assist the user and
are not intended to preclude the use of other correctly
applied units for the same symbol, such as ft or kip.
From a point of peak stress in reinforcement, some length of
reinforcement or anchorage is necessary to develop the stress.
This development length or anchorage is necessary on both
sides of such peak stress points. Often the reinforcement
continues for a considerable distance on one side of a critical
stress point so that calculations need involve only the other
side, for example, the negative moment reinforcement
continuing through a support to the middle of the next span.

and the anchorage or bond strength is substantially reduced. If
the cover and spacing between bars is large, a splitting failure
is precluded and the effect of the epoxy coating on anchorage
strength is not as large. Studies12.10 have shown that although
the cover or spacing may be small, the anchorage strength
may be increased by adding transverse steel crossing the
plane of splitting, and restraining the splitting crack.
Because the bond of epoxy-coated bars or zinc and epoxy
dual-coated bars is already reduced due to the loss of adhe-
sion between the bar and the concrete, an upper limit of 1.7
is established for the product of the factors for top reinforce-
ment and epoxy-coated reinforcement or zinc and epoxy
dual-coated reinforcement.
Although there is no requirement for transverse reinforce-
ment along the tension development or splice length, recent
research12.11,12.12 indicates that in concrete with very high
compressive strength, brittle anchorage failure occurred in
bars with inadequate transverse reinforcement. In splice

The effects of bar yield strength, excess reinforcement,
lightweight concrete, and factors to reflect the resistance to
splitting provided from confinement by concrete and trans-
verse ties or stirrups are based on recommendations from
References 12.2 and 12.3.
Tests12.13 indicate that closely spaced ties at or near the bend
portion of a hooked bar are most effective in confining the
hooked bar. For construction purposes, this is not always
practicable. The cases where the modification factor of
12.5.3(b) may be used are illustrated in Fig. R12.5.3(a) and

perpendicular to the bar being developed, spaced along the

is a simplification over the procedure in 12.2.3.3 of ACI

depending on the amount of lightweight aggregate used.
Unlike straight bar development, no distinction is made
between top bars and other bars; such a distinction is diffi-
cult for hooked bars in any case. A minimum value of l is

additional reductions in development length, such as those
allowed for standard hooks with additional confinement
provided by transverse reinforcement in 12.5.3, are not used
for headed deformed reinforcing bars. Transverse reinforce-
ment, however, helps limit splitting cracks in the vicinity of
the head and for that reason is recommended.
In 2011, the excess reinforcement factor for headed bars
was removed from the Code. The excess reinforcement
factor (A /A ), applicable to deformed bars
s required s provided
without heads, in not applicable for headed bars where force
is transferred through a combination of bearing at the head
and bond along the bar. Concrete breakout due to bearing at
the head was considered in developing the provisions of
12.6. Because the concrete breakout capacity of a headed
bar is a function of the embedment depth to the 1.5 power
(see Appendix D Eq. (D-6)), a reduction in development
length with the application of the excess reinforcement
factor could result in a potential concrete breakout failure.
Where longitudinal headed deformed bars from a beam or a
slab terminate at a supporting member, such as the column
shown in Fig. R12.6(b), the bars should extend through the
joint to the far face of the confined core of the supporting
member, allowing for cover and avoidance of interference
with column reinforcement, even though the resulting
anchorage length exceeds l . Extending the bar to the far
dt
side of the column core helps to anchor compressive forces
(as identified in a strut-and-tie model) that are likely to form in
such a connection and improves the performance of the joint.

Fig. R12.9—Idealized bilinear relationship between steel
stress and distance from the free end of strand.
The bond of strand is a function of a number of factors,
including the configuration and surface condition of the
steel, the stress in the steel, the depth of concrete beneath
the strand, and the method used to transfer the force in the
strand to the concrete. For bonded applications, quality
assurance procedures should be used to confirm that the
strand is capable of adequate bond.12.20,12.21 The precast
concrete manufacturer may rely on certification from the
strand manufacturer that the strand has bond characteristics
that comply with this section. Strand with a slightly rusted
surface can have an appreciably shorter transfer length than
clean strand. Gentle release of the strand will permit a
shorter transfer length than abruptly cutting the strands.
The provisions of 12.9 do not apply to plain wires or to end-
anchored tendons. The length for smooth wire could be
expected to be considerably greater due to the absence of
mechanical interlock. Flexural bond failure would occur
with plain wire when first slip occurred.

steel stress and the distance over which the strand is bonded

In determining if a member should be classified as a tension
tie, consideration should be given to the importance, func-
tion, proportions, and stress conditions of the member
related to the above characteristics. For example, a usual
large circular tank, with many bars and with splices well

Bond research has been primarily related to bars in tension.
Bond behavior of compression bars is not complicated by
the problem of transverse tension cracking and thus
compression splices do not require provisions as strict as
those specified for tension splices. The minimum lengths
for column splices contained originally in the 1956 Code
have been carried forward in later Codes, and extended to
compression bars in beams and to higher strength steels. No
changes have been made in the provisions for compression

up to 80,000 psi. Tests12.1,12.30 have shown that splice
strengths in compression depend considerably on end
bearing and do not increase proportionally in strength when
the splice length is doubled. Accordingly, for specified yield
strengths above 60,000 psi, compression lap lengths are
significantly increased, except where spiral enclosures are
used (as in spiral columns) the where the increase is about
10 percent for an increase in specified yield strength from
60,000 to 75,000 psi.

The 1989 Code clarifies this section on the basis that a
compressive lap splice has a tension strength of at least one-
quarter f , which simplifies the calculation requirements in
y
previous Codes.
Note that the column splice should satisfy requirements for
all load combinations for the column. Frequently, the basic
gravity load combination will govern the design of the
column itself, but a load combination including wind or
seismic loads may induce greater tension in some column
bars, and the column splice should be designed for this
tension.

For slabs with beams, the explicit design procedures of
Chapter 13 apply only when the beams are located at the
edges of the panel and when the beams are supported by
columns or other essentially nondeflecting supports at the
corners of the panel. Two-way slabs with beams in one
direction, with both slab and beams supported by girders in
the other direction, may be designed under the general
requirements of Chapter 13. Such designs should be based
upon analysis compatible with the deflected position of the
supporting beams and girders.
For slabs supported on walls, the explicit design procedures
in this chapter treat the wall as a beam of infinite stiffness;
therefore, each wall should support the entire length of an
edge of the panel (see 13.2.3). Wall-like columns less than a
full panel length can be treated as columns.

two-way slab systems are given in the ACI Design Hand-

including, in all cases, evaluation of the stress conditions
around the supports in relation to shear and torsion as well
as flexure. The design of a slab system involves more than
its analysis, and any deviations in physical dimensions of

basis of knowledge of the expected loads and the reliability
of the calculated stresses and deformations of the structure.

stiffness of slab members, and increases lateral flexibility when
lateral loads act on the structure. Cracking of slabs should be
considered in stiffness assumptions so that drift caused by
wind or earthquake is not grossly underestimated.
The structure may be modeled for lateral load analysis using
any approach that is shown to satisfy equilibrium and
geometric compatibility and to be in reasonable agreement
with test data.13.10,13.11 The selected approach should
recognize effects of cracking as well as parameters such as
l /l , c /l , and c /c . Some of the available approaches are

summarized in Reference 13.12, which includes a discussion
on the effects of cracking. Acceptable approaches include
plate-bending finite-element models, the effective beam
width model, and the equivalent frame model. In all cases,
framing member stiffnesses should be reduced to account
for cracking.
For nonprestressed slabs, it is normally appropriate to
reduce slab bending stiffness to between one-half and one-
quarter of the uncracked stiffness. For prestressed construction,
stiffnesses greater than those of cracked, nonprestressed
slabs may be appropriate. When the analysis is used to
determine design drifts or moment magnification, lower-
bound slab stiffnesses should be assumed. When the analysis is
used to study interactions of the slab with other framing
elements, such as structural walls, it may be appropriate to
consider a range of slab stiffnesses so that the relative
importance of the slab on those interactions can be assessed.

When the factored shear for a slab-column connection is
large, the slab-column joint cannot always develop all of the
reinforcement provided in the effective width. The modifi-
cations for interior slab-column connections in 13.5.3.3 are
permitted only when the reinforcement (within the effective
width) required to develop the unbalanced moment γ M
f u
has a net tensile strain ε not less than 0.010. The use of
t
Eq. (13-1) without the modification permitted in 13.5.3.3
will generally indicate overstress conditions on the joint.
The provisions of 13.5.3.3 are intended to improve ductile
behavior of the slab-column joint. When a reversal of
moments occurs at opposite faces of an interior support,
both top and bottom reinforcement should be concen-
trated within the effective width. A ratio of top to bottom
reinforcement of approximately 2 has been observed to
be appropriate.
For the 2008 Code, two changes were introduced to
13.5.3.3: (1) the limitation for the amount of reinforcement
in the effective slab width to 37.5 percent of the balanced
steel ratio was updated to refer to a minimum net tensile
strain of 0.010 to be consistent with the unified design
approach adopted in the 2002 Code, and (2) the requirement
for the minimum net tensile strain was eliminated for
moment transfer about the slab edge for edge and corner
connections based on the original recommendations from
Joint ACI-ASCE Committee 352.13.15
13.5.3.4 — Concentration of reinforcement over the
column by closer spacing or additional reinforcement

width defined in 13.5.3.2.
13.5.4 — Design for transfer of load from slabs to
supporting columns or walls through shear and torsion
shall be in accordance with Chapter 11.
13.6 — Direct design method R13.6 — Direct design method
The direct design method consists of a set of rules for
distributing moments to slab and beam sections to satisfy
safety requirements and most serviceability requirements
simultaneously. Three fundamental steps are involved as
follows:
(1) Determination of the total factored static moment (see
13.6.2);
(2) Distribution of the total factored static moment to
negative and positive sections (see 13.6.3);
(3) Distribution of the negative and positive factored
moments to the column and middle strips and to the
beams, if any (see 13.6.4 through 13.6.6). The distribution
of moments to column and middle strips is also used in
the equivalent frame method (see 13.7).

torsional stiffness can be obtained by assuming a moment
distribution along the torsional member that varies linearly
from a maximum at the center of the column to zero at the

such as pressure vessels, pavements, pipes, and crossties.
Application of the provisions is left to the judgment of the
licensed design professional in cases not specifically cited
in the Code.

8.12.4, 8.13, 10.5, 10.6, 10.9.1, and 10.9.2; Chapter 13; such exclusions:
and Sections 14.3, 14.5, and 14.6, except that certain
sections of 10.6 apply as noted in 18.4.4. Section 6.4.4 — Tendons of continuous post-tensioned
beams and slabs are usually stressed at a point along the
span where the tendon profile is at or near the centroid of
the concrete cross section. Therefore, interior construction
joints are usually located within the end thirds of the span,
rather than the middle third of the span as required by 6.4.4.
Construction joints located as described in continuous post-
tensioned beams and slabs have a long history of satisfactory
performance. Thus, 6.4.4 is excluded from application to
prestressed concrete.
Section 7.6.5 — Section 7.6.5 of the Code is excluded from
application to prestressed concrete because the requirements
for bonded reinforcement and unbonded tendons for cast-in-
place members are provided in 18.9 and 18.12, respectively.
Sections 8.12.2, 8.12.3, and 8.12.4 — The empirical
provisions of 8.12.2, 8.12.3, and 8.12.4 for T-beams were
developed for nonprestressed reinforced concrete, and if
applied to prestressed concrete would exclude many standard
prestressed products in satisfactory use today. Hence, proof
by experience permits variations.
By excluding 8.12.2, 8.12.3, and 8.12.4, no special require-
ments for prestressed concrete T-beams appear in the Code.
Instead, the determination of an effective width of flange is left
to the experience and judgment of the licensed design
professional. Where possible, the flange widths in 8.12.2,
8.12.3, and 8.12.4 should be used unless experience has
proven that variations are safe and satisfactory. It is not neces-
sarily conservative in elastic analysis and design considerations
to use the maximum flange width as permitted in 8.12.2.

CODE COMMENTARY
Sections 8.12.1 and 8.12.5 provide general requirements for
T-beams that are also applicable to prestressed concrete
members. The spacing limitations for slab reinforcement are
based on flange thickness, which for tapered flanges can be
taken as the average thickness.
Section 8.13 — The empirical limits established for
nonprestressed reinforced concrete joist floors are based on
successful past performance of joist construction using
standard joist forming systems. See R8.13. For prestressed
joist construction, experience and judgment should be used.
The provisions of 8.13 may be used as a guide.
Sections 10.5, 10.9.1, and 10.9.2 — For prestressed
concrete, the limitations on reinforcement given in 10.5,
10.9.1, and 10.9.2 are replaced by those in 18.8.3, 18.9, and
18.11.2.
Section 10.6 —This section does not apply to prestressed
members in its entirety. However, 10.6.4 and 10.6.7 are
referenced in 18.4.4 pertaining to Class C prestressed flexural
members.
Chapter 13 — The design of continuous prestressed concrete
slabs requires recognition of secondary moments. Also,
volume changes due to the prestressing force can create addi-
tional loads on the structure that are not adequately covered in
Chapter 13. Because of these unique properties associated
with prestressing, many of the design procedures of Chapter
13 are not appropriate for prestressed concrete structures and
are replaced by the provisions of 18.12.

may be other load stages that require investigation. For
example, if the cracking load is significant, this load stage
may require study, or the handling and transporting stage
may be critical.
From the standpoint of satisfactory behavior, the two
stages of most importance are those for service load and

The Code does not distinguish between temporary and
effective prestressing steel stresses. Only one limit on
prestressing steel stress is provided because the initial
prestressing steel stress (immediately after transfer) can
prevail for a considerable time, even after the structure has
been put into service. This stress, therefore, should have an
adequate safety factor under service conditions and cannot
be considered as a temporary stress. Any subsequent
decrease in prestressing steel stress due to losses can only
improve conditions and no limit on such stress decrease is

To determine the moments used in design, the order of
calculation should be: (a) determine moments due to dead
and live load; (b) modify by algebraic addition of secondary
moments; (c) redistribute as permitted. A positive secondary
moment at the support caused by a tendon transformed
downward from a concordant profile will reduce the negative
moments near the supports and increase the positive
moments in the midspan regions. A tendon that is transformed
upward will have the reverse effect.

CODE COMMENTARY
19.1 — Scope and definitions R19.1 — Scope and definitions
The Code and Commentary provide information on the
design, analysis, and construction of concrete thin shells
and folded plates. The process began in 1964 with the
publication of a practice and commentary by ACI
Committee 334,19.1 and continued with the inclusion of
Chapter 19 in the 1971 Code. The 1982 revision of ACI
334.1R reflected additional experience in design, analysis,
and construction and was influenced by the publication of
the “Recommendations for Reinforced Concrete Shells
and Folded Plates” of the International Association for
Shell and Spatial Structures (IASS) in 1979.19.2
Since Chapter 19 applies to concrete thin shells and folded
plates of all shapes, extensive discussion of their design,
analysis, and construction in the Commentary is not
possible. Additional information can be obtained from the
references. Performance of shells and folded plates requires
attention to detail.19.3

shell surface as-built from the idealized geometry; (2) large
deflections; (3) creep and shrinkage of concrete; (4)
inelastic properties of materials; (5) cracking of concrete;
(6) location, amount, and orientation of reinforcement; and
(7) possible deformation of supporting elements.
Measures successfully used to improve resistance to buckling
include the provision of two mats of reinforcement—one
near each outer surface of the shell, a local increase of shell
curvatures, the use of ribbed shells, and the use of concrete
with high tensile strength and low creep.
A procedure for determining critical buckling loads of shells
is given in the IASS recommendations.19.2 Some recom-
mendations for buckling design of domes used in industrial
applications are given in References 19.13 and 19.14.

been traditionally based on the assumption that concrete
does not resist tension. The associated deflections, and the
possibility of cracking, should be investigated in the
serviceability phase of the design. Achieving this may
require a working stress design for steel selection.

the concrete is assumed to be unable to resist either tension
or shear. Thus, equilibrium is attained by equating tensile-
resisting forces in reinforcement and compressive-resisting

whether a structure or a portion of a structure satisfies the
safety requirements of this Code. A strength evaluation may
be required if the materials are considered to be deficient in
quality, if there is evidence indicating faulty construction, if
a structure has deteriorated, if a building will be used for a
new function, or if, for any reason, a structure or a portion
of it does not appear to satisfy the requirements of the Code.
In such cases, Chapter 20 provides guidance for investigating
the safety of the structure.
If the safety concerns are related to an assembly of elements
or an entire structure, it is not feasible to load test every
element and section to the maximum. In such cases, it is
appropriate that an investigation plan be developed to
address the specific safety concerns. If a load test is
described as part of the strength evaluation process, it is
desirable for all parties involved to come to an agreement
about the region to be loaded, the magnitude of the load, the
load test procedure, and acceptance criteria before any load
tests are conducted.

Structures assigned to SDC D, E, or F may be subjected to
strong ground shaking. It is the intent of Committee 318 that
the seismic-force-resisting system of structural concrete
buildings assigned to SDC D, E, or F be provided by special
moment frames, special structural walls, or a combination
of the two. In addition to 21.1.2 through 21.1.8, these
structures also are required to satisfy requirements for
continuous inspection (1.3.5), diaphragms and trusses
(21.11), foundations (21.12), and gravity-load-resisting
elements that are not designated as part of the seismic-
force-resisting system (21.13). These provisions have been
developed to provide the structure with adequate toughness
for the high demands expected for these SDCs.
The legally adopted general building code of which this
Code forms a part may also permit the use of intermediate
moment frames as part of dual systems for some buildings
assigned to SDC D, E, or F. It is not the intention of
Committee 318 to recommend the use of intermediate
moment frames as part of moment-resisting frame or dual
systems in SDC D, E, or F. The legally adopted general
building code may also permit substantiated alternative or
nonprescriptive designs or, with various supplementary provi-
sions, the use of ordinary or intermediate systems for
nonbuilding structures in the higher SDCs. These are not the
typical applications around which this chapter is written, but
wherever the term “ordinary” or “intermediate” moment frame
is used in reference to reinforced concrete, 21.2 or 21.3 apply.
Table R21.1.1 summarizes the applicability of the provisions
of Chapter 21 as they are typically applied where using
minimum requirements in the various SDCs. Where special
systems are used for structures in SDC B or C, it is not
required to satisfy the requirements of 21.13, although it
should be verified that members not designated as part of
the seismic-force-resisting system will be stable under
design displacements.

precast concrete building structures designed and detailed to
behave like monolithic building structures. Extrapolation of
these requirements to other types of cast-in-place or precast
concrete structures should be based on evidence provided
by field experience, tests, or analysis. The acceptance
criteria for moment frames given in ACI 374.1 can be used
in conjunction with Chapter 21 to demonstrate that the
strength and toughness of a proposed frame system equals
or exceeds that provided by a comparable monolithic
concrete system. ACI ITG-5.1 provides similar information
for precast wall systems.
The toughness requirements in 21.1.1.8 refer to the concern
for the structural integrity of the entire seismic-force-
resisting system at lateral displacements anticipated for
ground motions corresponding to the design earthquake.
Depending on the energy-dissipation characteristics of the
structural system used, such displacements may be larger
than for a monolithic reinforced concrete structure.

above the base of structure. For lateral displacement calculations, assuming all the
horizontal structural members to be fully cracked is likely to
lead to better estimates of the possible drift than using
uncracked stiffness for all members. The analysis
assumptions described in 8.8 also may be used to estimate
lateral deflections of reinforced concrete building systems.
The main objective of Chapter 21 is the safety of the structure.
The intent of 21.1.2.1 and 21.1.2.2 is to draw attention to
the influence of nonstructural members on structural
response and to hazards from falling objects.
Section 21.1.2.3 serves as an alert that the base of structure as
defined in analysis may not necessarily correspond to the
foundation or ground level. Details of columns and walls
extending below the base of structure to the foundation are
required to be consistent with those above the base of structure.
In selecting member sizes for earthquake-resistant struc-
tures, it is important to consider constructibility problems
related to congestion of reinforcement. The design should
be such that all reinforcement can be assembled and placed
in the proper location and that concrete can be cast and
consolidated properly. Use of upper limits of reinforcement
ratios permitted is likely to lead to insurmountable construction
problems, especially at frame joints.

balanced conditions. For a section subjected to bending only
and loaded monotonically to yielding, this approach is
feasible because the likelihood of compressive failure can
be estimated reliably with the behavioral model assumed for
determining the reinforcement ratio corresponding to
balanced failure. The same behavioral model (because of
incorrect assumptions such as linear strain distribution,
well-defined yield point for the steel, limiting compressive
strain in the concrete of 0.003, and compressive stresses in
the shell concrete) does not describe the conditions in a flexural

the column depth in the direction of loading for the
maximum size of beam bars for normalweight concrete and
a limit of 1/26 for lightweight concrete were chosen. Due to
the lack of specific data for beam bars through lightweight
concrete joints, the limit was based on the amplification
factor of 1.3 in Chapter 12 starting with the 1989 Code. The
amplification factor was modified slightly in 2008 to 1/0.75

the beam bars in a beam-column joint, considering the

and collectors depend on which general building code is
used. The requirements may also vary according to the SDC.
For most concrete buildings subjected to inelastic earth-
quake demands, it is desirable to limit inelastic behavior of
floor and roof diaphragms under the imposed earthquake
forces and deformations. It is preferable for inelastic
behavior to occur only in the intended locations of the
vertical earthquake-force-resisting system that are detailed
for ductile response, such as in the beam plastic hinges of
special moment frames, or in flexural plastic hinging at the
base of structural walls or in coupling beams. For buildings
without long diaphragm spans between lateral-force-
resisting elements, elastic diaphragm behavior is typically

The influence of slab openings on flexural and shear strength is
to be considered, including evaluating the potential critical
sections created by the openings. Strut-and-tie models are
potentially useful for designing diaphragms with openings.
Earlier design practice assumed design moments for structural
diaphragms were resisted entirely by chord forces acting at
opposite edges of the diaphragm. This idealization was
implicit in earlier versions of the Code, but has been
replaced by an approach in which all longitudinal reinforce-
ment, within the limits of 21.11.7, is assumed to contribute
to the flexural strength of the diaphragm. This change
reduces the required area of longitudinal reinforcement
concentrated near the edge of the diaphragm, but should not
be interpreted as a requirement to eliminate all boundary
reinforcement.

22.1 — Scope R22.1 — Scope
22.1.1 — This chapter provides minimum requirements Before the 1995 Code, requirements for plain concrete were
for design and construction of structural plain concrete set forth in “Building Code Requirements for Structural
members (cast-in-place or precast). Plain Concrete (ACI 318.1-89) (Revised 1992).” Require-
ments for plain concrete are now in this Code (see 2.2 for
definition of plain concrete). Limitations are provided in
22.2 to clarify the scope and applicability of this chapter.
See 1.1.4 for requirements for residential construction
within the scope of ACI 332.
22.1.2 — Unless in conflict with the provisions of R22.1.2 — Sections of the Code do not apply to the design of
Chapter 22, the following provisions of this Code shall structural plain concrete for the following specific reasons:
apply to structural plain concrete members: Sections
1.1 through 7.5, 7.6.1, 7.6.2, 7.6.4, 7.7, 9.1.3, 9.2, 9.3.5, Sections 7.6 and 7.8 through 7.13 — These sections
Chapter 20, 21.12.2.5, C.9.2, C.9.3.5, and Appendix D. contain requirements intended for reinforced concrete
members and, with the exception of 7.6.1, 7.6.2, and 7.6.4,
are not applicable to structural plain concrete members, for
which strength is determined only by member size and
concrete strength, and not by reinforcement (see 22.5).
Concrete cover requirements of 7.7 apply to structural plain
concrete members if reinforcement is provided.
Chapters 8 through 19 — These chapters of the Code
contain general and specific design requirements for reinforced
and prestressed concrete members, including walls and
foundations, which are not applicable to structural plain
concrete, except for 9.1.3, 9.2, and 9.3.5 where applicable
load factors and strength reduction factors for structural
plain concrete are specified.
Chapter 21 — This chapter contains seismic design
requirements for reinforced concrete members and is not
applicable to structural plain concrete except in the sections
of the chapter where structural plain concrete is specifically
addressed.
Appendixes A and B — Appendixes A and B are intended
for reinforced concrete members and are not applicable to

Since plain concrete lacks the necessary ductility that
columns should possess and because a random crack in an
unreinforced column will most likely endanger its structural
integrity, the Code does not permit use of plain concrete for
columns. It does allow its use for pedestals limited to a ratio
of unsupported height to least lateral dimension of 3 or less
(see 22.8.2).
Structural elements such as cast-in-place concrete piles and
piers in ground or other material sufficiently stiff to provide
adequate lateral support to prevent buckling are not covered
by this Code. Such elements are covered by the general
building code.

approach a linear distribution at a distance approximately
equal to the overall height of the member, h, away from the
discontinuity. For this reason, discontinuities are assumed to
extend a distance h from the section where the load or
change in geometry occurs. Figure RA.1.1(a) shows typical
geometric discontinuities, and Fig. RA.1.1(b) shows
combined geometrical and loading discontinuities.

of 10.2.2 is not applicable in such regions.
Each shear span of the beam in Fig. RA.1.2(a) is a D-region.
If two D-regions overlap or meet as shown in Fig. RA.1.2(b),
they can be considered as a single D-region for design
purposes. The maximum length-to-depth ratio of such a
D-region would be approximately 2. Thus, the smallest
angle between the strut and the tie in a D-region is arctan 1/2
= 26.5 degrees, rounded to 25 degrees.
If there is a B-region between the D-regions in a shear span,
as shown in Fig. RA.1.2(c), the strength of the shear span is
governed by the strength of the B-region if the B- and D-
regions have similar geometry and reinforcement.A.2 This is
because the shear strength of a B-region is less than the
shear strength of a comparable D-region. Shear spans

that is assumed to transfer strut-and-tie forces through in Fig. RA.1.4 were used. These were largely superseded by
the node. what are called extended nodal zones, shown in Fig. RA.1.5.
A hydrostatic nodal zone has loaded faces perpendicular to
the axes of the struts and ties acting on the node and has
equal stresses on the loaded faces. Figure RA.1.4(a) shows a
C-C-C nodal zone. If the stresses on the face of the nodal
zone are the same in all three struts, the ratios of the lengths
of the sides of the nodal zone, w : w : w are in the same
n1 n2 n3
proportions as the three forces C : C : C . The faces of a
1 2 3
hydrostatic nodal zone are perpendicular to the axes of the
struts and ties acting on the nodal zone.
These nodal zones are called hydrostatic nodal zones
because the in-plane stresses are the same in all directions.
Strictly speaking, this terminology is incorrect because the
in-plane stresses are not equal to the out-of-plane stresses.
A C-C-T nodal zone can be represented as a hydrostatic nodal
zone if the tie is assumed to extend through the node to be
anchored by a plate on the far side of the node, as shown in
Fig. RA.1.4(b), provided that the size of the plate results in
bearing stresses that are equal to the stresses in the struts. The
bearing plate on the left side of Fig. RA.1.4(b) is used to
represent an actual tie anchorage. The tie force can be
anchored by a plate, or through development of straight or
hooked bars, as shown in Fig. RA.1.4(c).
The shaded areas in Fig. RA.1.5(a) and (b) are extended
nodal zones. An extended nodal zone is that portion of a
member bounded by the intersection of the effective strut
width, w , and the effective tie width, w (see RA.4.2).

The curved dashed outlines of the struts in Fig. RA.1.3

the boundaries of bottle-shaped struts. A split cylinder
test is an example of a bottle-shaped strut. The internal

To simplify design, bottle-shaped struts are idealized

transverse tension. The amount of confining transverse
reinforcement can be computed using the strut-and-tie
model shown in Fig. RA.1.8(b) with the struts that represent

struts, a hydrostatic nodal zone can be used and the widths
of the struts will be in proportion to the forces in the struts.
If more than three forces act on a nodal zone in a two-dimen-
sional structure, as shown in Fig. RA.2.3(b), it is generally
necessary to resolve some of the forces to end up with three
intersecting forces. The strut forces acting on Faces A-E and
C-E in Fig. RA.2.3(b) can be replaced with one force acting
on Face A-C. This force passes through the node at D.
Alternatively, the strut-and-tie model could be analyzed
assuming all the strut forces acted through the node at D, as
shown in Fig. RA.2.3(c). In this case, the forces in the two
struts on the right side of Node D can be resolved into a single
force acting through Point D, as shown in Fig. RA.2.3(d).
If the width of the support in the direction perpendicular to
the member is less than the width of the member, transverse
reinforcement may be required to restrain vertical splitting
in the plane of the node. This can be modeled using a
transverse strut-and-tie model.

Fig. RB.8.4—Permissible moment redistribution for
minimum rotation capacity.
Using conservative values of ultimate concrete strains and
lengths of plastic hinges derived from extensive tests, flexural
members with small rotation capacity were analyzed for
moment redistribution up to 20 percent, depending on the
reinforcement ratio. The results were found to be conservative
(see Fig. RB.8.4). Studies by CohnB.2 and MattockB.3
support this conclusion and indicate that cracking and
deflection of beams designed for moment redistribution are
not significantly greater at service loads than for beams
designed by the elastic theory distribution of moments. Also,
these studies indicated that adequate rotation capacity for the
moment redistribution allowed by the Code is available if
the members satisfy the Code requirements. This appendix
maintains the same limit on redistribution as used in
previous Code editions.
Moment redistribution may not be used for slab systems
designed by the direct design method (see 13.6.1.7).

One condition where greater ductile behavior is required is
in design for redistribution of moments in continuous

moment redistribution. Since moment redistribution is
dependent on adequate ductility in hinge regions, the
amount of tension reinforcement in hinging regions is
limited to 0.5ρ .

8.12.3, 8.12.4, 8.13, B.10.3.3, 10.5, 10.6, 10.9.1, and for such exclusions:
10.9.2; Chapter 13; and Sections 14.3, 14.5, and 14.6.
Section 6.4.4 — Tendons of continuous post-tensioned
beams and slabs are usually stressed at a point along the
span where the tendon profile is at or near the centroid of
the concrete cross section. Therefore, interior construction
joints are usually located within the end thirds of the span,
rather than the middle third of the span as required by 6.4.4.
Construction joints located as described in continuous post-
tensioned beams and slabs have a long history of satisfactory
performance. Thus, 6.4.4 is excluded from application to
prestressed concrete.
Section 7.6.5 — Section 7.6.5 is excluded from application
to prestressed concrete since the requirements for bonded
reinforcement and unbonded tendons for cast-in-place
members are provided in 18.9 and 18.12, respectively.
Section B.8.4 — Moment redistribution for prestressed
concrete is provided in B.8.4.

of 8.12.2, 8.12.3, and 8.12.4 for T-beams were developed

prestressed concrete, would exclude many standard
prestressed products in satisfactory use today. Hence, proof
by experience permits variations.
By excluding 8.12.2, 8.12.3, and 8.12.4, no special require-
ments for prestressed concrete T-beams appear in the Code.
Instead, the determination of an effective width of flange is
left to the experience and judgment of the licensed design
professional. Where possible, the flange widths in 8.12.2,
8.12.3, and 8.12.4 should be used unless experience has
proven that variations are safe and satisfactory. It is not
necessarily conservative in elastic analysis and design
considerations to use the maximum flange width as
permitted in 8.12.2.
Sections 8.12.1 and 8.12.5 provide general requirements for
T-beams that are also applicable to prestressed concrete
units. The spacing limitations for slab reinforcement are
based on flange thickness, which for tapered flanges can be
taken as the average thickness.
Section 8.13 — The empirical limits established for conven-
tionally reinforced concrete joist floors are based on
successful past performance of joist construction using
“standard” joist forming systems. See R8.13. For prestressed
joist construction, experience and judgment should be used.
The provisions of 8.13 may be used as a guide.
Sections B.10.3.3, 10.5, 10.9.1, and 10.9.2 — For
prestressed concrete, the limitations on reinforcement given
in B.10.3.3, 10.5, 10.9.1, and 10.9.2 are replaced by those in
B.18.8, 18.9, and 18.11.2.
Section 10.6 — When originally prepared, the provisions of
10.6 for distribution of flexural reinforcement were not
intended for prestressed concrete members. The behavior of
a prestressed member is considerably different from that a
nonprestressed member. Experience and judgment should
be used for proper distribution of reinforcement in a
prestressed member.
Chapter 13 — The design of prestressed concrete slabs
requires recognition of secondary moments induced by the
undulating profile of the prestressing tendons. Also, volume
changes due to the prestressing force can create additional
loads on the structure that are not adequately covered in
Chapter 13. Because of these unique properties associated
with prestressing, many of the design procedures of Chapter 13
are not appropriate for prestressed concrete structures and
are replaced by the provisions of 18.12.
Sections 14.5 and 14.6 — The requirements for wall design
in 14.5 and 14.6 are largely empirical, utilizing consider-
ations not intended to apply to prestressed concrete.

amount of inelastic rotation required to obtain a given
amount of moment redistribution. Conversely, for a beam
with a given inelastic rotation capacity, the amount by
which the moment at the support may be varied is changed
by an amount equal to the secondary moment at the support
due to prestressing. Thus, the Code requires that secondary
moments be included in determining design moments.
To determine the moments used in design, the order of
calculation should be: (a) determine moments due to dead
load and live load; (b) modify by algebraic addition of
secondary moments; and (c) redistribute as permitted. A
positive secondary moment at the support caused by a tendon
transformed downward from a concordant profile will reduce
the negative moments near the supports and increase the
positive moments in the midspan regions. A tendon that is
transformed upward will have the reverse effect.

Ideally, for tension loadings, anchor strength should be
governed by yielding of the ductile steel element of the
anchor. If the anchor cannot meet the specified ductility
requirements of D.3.3.4.3(a), then the attachment should be
either designed to yield if it is structural or light gauge steel,
or designed to crush if it is wood. If ductility requirements
of D.3.3.4.3(a) are satisfied, then any attachments to the
anchor should be designed not to yield. In designing attach-
ments using yield mechanisms to provide adequate ductility,
as permitted by D.3.3.4.3(b) and D.3.3.5.3(a), the ratio of
specified yield strength to expected strength for the material
of the attachment should be considered in determining the
design force. The value used for the expected strength
should consider both material overstrength and strain-
hardening effects. For example, the material in a connection
element could yield and, due to an increase in its strength
with strain hardening, cause a secondary failure of a sub-
element or place extra force or deformation demands on the
anchors. For a structural steel attachment, if only the specified
yield strength of the steel is known, the expected strength
should be taken as about 1.5 times the specified yield
strength. If the actual yield strength of the steel is known,
the expected strength should be taken as about 1.25 times
the actual yield strength.
Under seismic conditions, the direction of shear may not be
predictable. The full shear force should be assumed in any
direction for a safe design.

D.3.3.5 — Requirements for shear loading RD.3.3.5 — Requirements for shear loading
Where the shear component of the earthquake force applied
to the anchor exceeds 20 percent of the total anchor shear
force, three options are recognized for determining the
required shear strength to protect the anchor or group of
anchors against premature shear failure. There is no option
corresponding to option (a) of D.3.3.4.3 because the cross
section of the steel element of the anchor cannot be configured
so that steel failure in shear provides any meaningful degree
of ductility.
Design of the anchor or group of anchors for the strength
associated with force-limiting mechanisms under option (b),
such as the bearing strength at holes in a steel attachment or
the combined crushing and bearing strength for wood
members may be particularly relevant. Tests on typical
anchor bolt connections for wood framed shear wallsD.11
showed that wood components attached to concrete with
minimum edge distances exhibited ductile behavior. Wood
“yield” (crushing) was the first limiting state and resulted in
nail slippage in shear. Nail slippage combined with bolt
bending provided the required ductility and toughness for
the shear walls and limited the loads acting on the bolts.
Procedures for defining bearing and shear limit states for
connections to cold-formed steel are described in AISI
S100-07D.12 and examples of strength calculations are
provided in the AISI “Cold-Formed Steel Design
Manual.”D.13 In such cases, consideration should be given
to whether exceedance of the bearing strength may lead to
tearing and an unacceptable loss of connectivity. Where
anchors are located far from edges it may not be possible to
design such that anchor reinforcement controls the anchor
strength. In such cases, anchors should be designed for
overstrength in accordance with option (c).

1. Type and duration of loading — bond strength is
reduced for sustained tension loading;
2. Concrete cracking — bond strength is higher in
uncracked concrete;
3. Anchor size — bond strength is generally inversely
proportional to anchor diameter;
4. Drilling method — bond strength may be lower for
anchors installed in core drilled holes;
5. Degree of concrete saturation at time of hole drilling
and anchor installation — bond strength may be reduced
due to concrete saturation;
6. Concrete temperature at time of installation — installation
of anchors in cold conditions may result in retarded
adhesive cure and reduced bond strength;
7. Concrete age at time of installation — installation in
early-age concrete may result in reduced bond strength
(see RD.2.2);
8. Peak concrete temperatures during anchor service life —
under specific conditions (for example, anchors in thin
concrete members exposed to direct sunlight), elevated
concrete temperatures can result in reduced bond
strength; and
9. Chemical exposure — anchors used in industrial envi-
ronments may be exposed to increased levels of contami-
nants that can reduce bond strength over time.
Anchors tested and assessed under ACI 355.4 may in some
cases not be qualified for all of the installation and service
environments represented in Table D.5.5.2. Therefore, even
where the minimum values given in Table D.5.5.2 are used
for design, the relevant installation and service environ-

only anchors that have been qualified under ACI 355.4 for

the characteristic bond stress taken from Table D.5.5.2

For the case of anchors near a corner subjected to a shear force
with components normal to each edge, a satisfactory solution is
to check independently the connection for each component of
the shear force. Other specialized cases, such as the shear
resistance of anchor groups where all anchors do not have
the same edge distance, are treated in Reference D.20.
The detailed provisions of D.6.2.1(a) apply to the case of
shear force directed toward an edge. When the shear force is
directed away from the edge, the strength will usually be
governed by D.6.1 or D.6.3.
The case of shear force parallel to an edge is shown in

arise with shear force parallel to the edge near a corner. In the

the provisions for shear force applied perpendicular to the
edge should be checked in addition to the provisions for
shear force applied parallel to the edge.

enclosing reinforcement (see Fig. RD.6.2.9(a)) are based
was limited to anchor reinforcement with maximum diameter
similar to a No. 5 bar. The larger bend radii associated with
larger bar diameters may significantly reduce the effectiveness
of the anchor reinforcement, and therefore anchor reinforce-
ment with a diameter larger than No. 6 is not recommended.
The reinforcement could also consist of stirrups and ties (as
well as hairpins) enclosing the edge reinforcement
embedded in the breakout cone and placed as close to the
anchors as practicable (see Fig. RD.6.2.9(b)). Only rein-
forcement spaced less than the lesser of 0.5c and 0.3c
a1 a2
from the anchor centerline should be included as anchor
reinforcement. In this case, the anchor reinforcement must
be developed on both sides of the breakout surface. For
equilibrium reasons, an edge reinforcement must be present.
The research on which these provisions are based was
limited to anchor reinforcement with maximum diameter
similar to a No. 6 bar.
Because the anchor reinforcement is placed below where
the shear is applied (see Fig. RD.6.2.9(b)), the force in the
anchor reinforcement will be larger than the shear force. In
sizing the anchor reinforcement, use of a 0.75 strength
reduction factor φ is recommended as used for shear and for
strut-and-tie models. If the alternate load factors of
Appendix C are used, the corresponding strength reduction
factor of 0.85 for shear and strut-and-tie models should be
used. As a practical matter, the use of anchor reinforcement
is generally limited to cast-in-place anchors.

positioned in the formwork and oriented in accordance with
the contract documents. Furthermore, it should be ensured
that the concrete around the anchors is properly consoli-
dated. Inspection is particularly important for post-installed
anchors to make certain that the Manufacturer’s Printed
Installation Instructions (MPII) are followed. For adhesive
anchors, continuous monitoring of installations by qualified
inspectors is recommended to ensure required installation
procedures are followed. Post-installed anchor strength and
deformation capacity are assessed by acceptance testing
under ACI 355.2 or ACI 355.4. These tests are carried out
assuming installation in accordance with the MPII. Certain
types of anchors can be sensitive to variations in hole diameter,
cleaning conditions, orientation of the axis, magnitude of
the installation torque, crack width, and other variables.
Some of this sensitivity is indirectly accounted for in the
assigned φ values for the different anchor categories, which

drilling and preparation. 1. Acceptable anchor installation environment (dry or
saturated concrete; concrete temperature range);
2. Acceptable drilling methods;
3. Required hole cleaning procedures; and
4. Anchor type and size range (threaded rod or reinforcing
bar).
Hole cleaning is intended to ensure that drilling debris and
dust do not impair bond. Depending on the on-site conditions,
hole cleaning may involve operations to remove drilling
debris from the hole with vacuum or compressed air,
mechanical brushing of the hole wall to remove surface
dust, and a final step to evacuate any remaining dust or
debris, usually with compressed air. Where wet core drilling
is used, holes may be flushed with water and then dried with
compressed air. If anchors are installed in locations where
the concrete is saturated (for example, outdoor locations
exposed to rainfall), the resulting drilling mud must be
removed by other means. In all cases, the procedures used
should be clearly described by the manufacturer in printed
installation instructions accompanying the product. These
printed installation instructions, which also describe the
limits on concrete temperature and the presence of water
during installation as well as the procedures necessary for
void-free adhesive injection and adhesive cure require-
ments, constitute an integral part of the adhesive anchor
system and are part of the assessment performed in accordance
with ACI 355.4.

Advancing concrete knowledge
As ACI begins its second century of advancing concrete knowledge, its original chartered purpose
remains “to provide a comradeship in finding the best ways to do concrete work of all kinds and in
spreading knowledge.” In keeping with this purpose, ACI supports the following activities:
· Technical committees that produce consensus reports, guides, specifications, and codes.
· Spring and fall conventions to facilitate the work of its committees.
· Educational seminars that disseminate reliable information on concrete.
· Certification programs for personnel employed within the concrete industry.
· Student programs such as scholarships, internships, and competitions.
· Sponsoring and co-sponsoring international conferences and symposia.
· Formal coordination with several international concrete related societies.
· Periodicals: the ACI Structural Journal and the ACI Materials Journal, and Concrete International.
Benefits of membership include a subscription to Concrete International and to an ACI Journal. ACI
members receive discounts of up to 40% on all ACI products and services, including documents, seminars
and convention registration fees.

Building Code Requirements for Structural Concrete
and Commentary
The AMERICAN CONCRETE INSTITUTE
was founded in 1904 as a nonprofit membership organization dedicated to public
service and representing the user interest in the field of concrete. ACI gathers and
distributes information on the improvement of design, construction and
maintenance of concrete products and structures. The work of ACI is conducted by
individual ACI members and through volunteer committees composed of both
members and non-members.
The committees, as well as ACI as a whole, operate under a consensus format,
which assures all participants the right to have their views considered. Committee
activities include the development of building codes and specifications; analysis of
research and development results; presentation of construction and repair
techniques; and education.
Individuals interested in the activities of ACI are encouraged to become a member.
There are no educational or employment requirements. ACI’s membership is
composed of engineers, architects, scientists, contractors, educators, and
representatives from a variety of companies and organizations.
Members are encouraged to participate in committee activities that relate to their
specific areas of interest. For more information, contact ACI.
