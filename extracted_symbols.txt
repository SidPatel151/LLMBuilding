2.3‚ÄîTerminology
adhesive‚Äîchemical 
components 
formulated 
from 
organic polymers, or a combination of organic polymers and 
inorganic materials that cure if blended together.
admixture‚Äîmaterial other than water, aggregate, 
FHPHQWLWLRXVPDWHULDOVDQG¬øEHUUHLQIRUFHPHQWXVHGDVDQ
ingredient, which is added to grout, mortar, or concrete, 
either before or during its mixing, to modify the freshly 
mixed, setting, or hardened properties of the mixture.
aggregate‚Äîgranular material, such as sand, gravel, 
crushed stone, iron blast-furnace slag, or recycled aggre-
gates including crushed hydraulic cement concrete, used 
with a cementing medium to form concrete or mortar.
aggregate, lightweight‚Äîaggregate meeting the require-
ments of ASTM C330 and having a loose bulk density of 
OEIW3 or less, determined in accordance with ASTM C29.
alternative cement‚Äîan inorganic cement that can be used 
as a complete replacement for portland cement or blended 
hydraulic cement, and that is not covered by applicable spec-
L¬øFDWLRQVIRUSRUWODQGRUEOHQGHGK\GUDXOLFFHPHQWV
anchor‚Äîa steel element either cast into concrete or 
post-installed into a hardened concrete member and used to 
transmit applied loads to the concrete.

aggregate‚ÄîThe use of recycled aggregate is addressed

in ASTM C33 is very broad and is likely to include mate-
rials that would not be expected to meet the intent of the 
provisions of this Code for use in structural concrete. Use 
of recycled aggregates including crushed hydraulic-cement 
concrete in structural concrete requires additional precau-
tions. See 26.4.1.2.1(c).
aggregate, lightweight‚ÄîIn some standards, the term 
‚Äúlightweight aggregate‚Äù is being replaced by the term ‚Äúlow-
density aggregate.‚Äù
alternative cements‚ÄîAlternative cements are described 
in the references listed in R26.4.1.1.1(b). Refer to 
26.4.1.1.1(b) for precautions when using these materials in 
concrete covered by this Code.
anchor‚ÄîCast-in anchors include headed bolts, hooked 
bolts (J- or L-bolt), and headed studs. Post-installed anchors 
include expansion anchors, undercut anchors, screw 
anchors, and adhesive anchors; steel elements for adhesive 
anchors include threaded rods, deformed reinforcing bars, or 
internally threaded steel sleeves with external deformations. 
Anchor types are shown in Fig. R2.1.
